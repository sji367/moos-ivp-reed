Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data 
from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, 
U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Los Angeles, California. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

 
CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


BUOYAGE
IALA Buoyage System, Region B, is in effect in the
area covered by this chart. See Chart No. 1.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Administration Area
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This
area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime
zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to 
its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
