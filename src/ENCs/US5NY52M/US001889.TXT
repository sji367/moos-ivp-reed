The inlet is subject to frequent changes. Buoys 
are not charted because they are moved period-
ically to mark the best passage. Charted hydro-
graphy from the entrance buoy to Democrat Point 
is from surveys dated Mar 2012. 
Mariners are warned to beware of 
extreme tidal turbulence, especially during times 
of tidal change.
