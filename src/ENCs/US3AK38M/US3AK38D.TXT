Decreases of charted depths by as much as
4.5 meters/15 feet to 6 meters/20 feet have 
been reported in Yakutat Bay in an area adjacent 
to Schooner Beach from Point Manby to Kame 
Stream as a result of the February 28, 1979, 
earthquake. Mariners are urged to exercise 
extreme caution when navigating in this area, 
and throughout Yakutat Bay in general, as the 
magnitude of change is not known.
