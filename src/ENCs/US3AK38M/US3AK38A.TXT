NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilots 8 & 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are
published in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, International 
Boundary Commission, and Geological Survey.

CAUTION - SEDIMENT
Mariners are advised that in areas such as Yakutat Bay, a layer 
boundary with a steep thermal/salinity gradient and/or suspended
sediments in the water column can produce erroneous bottom traces
on echo sounders. If this anomaly is suspected, a hand-held lead 
line should be used to penetrate the layer for an accurate reading.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio Stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
	
Althorp Peak, AK     KZZ-86      162.425 MHz
Mt. Robert Barron    KZZ-87      162.450 MHz
Yakutat, AK          WXK-69      162.400 MHz

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilots 8 and 9 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - SHOALING
Shoaling, as much as 1.8 meters/6 feet, has been dis-
closed in several critical shoal areas from
Cross Sound to Excursion Inlet. It is probable
that the Alaskan earthquake of July 10, 1958 
created these shoaling and others not yet 
discovered. Mariners are urged to use caution 
when navigating over or near critical depths. 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION - VESSSEL TRANSITING NOTE
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California. See U.S. Coast Pilots 8 and 9, Chapter 3 for details.

TIDAL INFORMATION
