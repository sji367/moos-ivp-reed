NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids 
to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


CAUTION - FRESHETS
Freshets occur annually during the months of May, June, and July 
which may cause some shoaling; however, channels are restored 
to project depths as soon thereafter as possible.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


STATUTE MILES - COLUMBIA AND WILLAMETTE RIVERS
Mileage distances along the Columbia and 
Willamette Rivers are in Statute Miles. Distances
along the Columbia River are eastward from the 
mouth, and along the Willamette River are south-
ward from the junction of the Columbia River.
Tables for converting Statute Miles to Interna-
tional Nautical Miles are given in U.S. Coast 
Pilot 7.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


TIDES
The diurnal range of the tide during low stages is 1.8 feet at
Vancouver (45°37'N, 122°40'W), 2.2 feet at St. Johns (45°35'N, 122°46'W)
and 2.4 feet at Portland (45°31'N, 122°40'W). The range becomes
progressively smaller with higher stages of the river.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


CAUTION - NUMEROUS OBSTRUCTIONS
Numerous obstructions found in 2009, consis-
ting mainly of submerged snags and ruined piles,
are not charted in the Willamette and Columbia
Rivers and Multnomah channel south of the 
Sauvie island Fixed Bridge. These obstructions
do not present a hazard to surface navigation,
but should be taken into consideration for
ground fishing and anchoring.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
