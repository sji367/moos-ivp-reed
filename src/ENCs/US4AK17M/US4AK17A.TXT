RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.   
Raspberry I, AK	 	KZZ-90 		162.425 MHz 
Sitkinak Dome, AK	WNG-718		162.450 MHz  


TIDAL INFORMATION
No tidal observations are available for the area
covered by this chart.


CAUTION 
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have
occurred in the area of this chart as a result of the earthquake
of March 27, 1964.  Tidal observations since the earthquake
indicate bottom subsidence of -1 meters\-0.6 feet at Lazy Bay. Mariners
are urged to use extreme caution when navigating in the area
of this chart as the magnitude of change except at this site is
not known.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
