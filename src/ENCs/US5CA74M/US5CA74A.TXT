AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,

Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
 
CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges
 
CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
San Diego, CA	KEC-62	162.400 MHz

CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS  
The cable and pipeline areas falling within
the areas of the larger scale charts are shown
thereon and are not repeated.

NOTE D
Submerged submarine operations are
conducted at various times in the waters contained.
Proceed with caution.

VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British
Columbia Oil Spill Task Force endorse a system of
voluntary measures and minimum distances from
shore for certain commercial vessels transiting
along the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet,
Alaska and San Diego, California. See U.S. Coast
Pilot 7, Chapter 7 details.
