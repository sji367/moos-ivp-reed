AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys 
and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, 
and U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.

NOTE A
Navigation regulation are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6. 
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. 
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of 
the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE Z:
No-Discharge Zone, 40 CFR 140 Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, 
all vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited 
from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the waters. Commercial 
vessel sewage shall include graywater. All vessels with an installed marine 
sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked within a 
NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage 
(treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations for the NDZ are 
contained in the U. S. Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning the 
regulations and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES. 
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances 
are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard 
facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - PERIODIC HIGH WATER
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features 
charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in 
the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with caution. 

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated on this chart. 
See Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, 
certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within 
the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are 
required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. 
Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water 
comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - IMPROVED CHANNELS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge sewage, 
or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent to domestic water intakes 
as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93).  
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. 
Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as 
racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service station listed below provides continuous 
marine weather broadcasts. The range of reception is variable, but for most 
stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the antenna site.

Buffalo, New York.		KEB-98        162.55 MHz.(Chan. WX-1)

Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are 
subject to error and should be used with caution.

WARNING
The prudent mariner will not rely soley on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine 
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Imagery and Mapping Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are 
subject to error and should be used with caution.
