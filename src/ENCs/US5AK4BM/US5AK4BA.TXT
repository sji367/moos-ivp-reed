NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels 
are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. 
These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted 
features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist 
in federal channels.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
Supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 8 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
