NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-

is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 and Canadian Sailing Directions, Great Lakes, Vol.1 
for important supplemental information.
Information concerning Canadian Nautical Charts, Sailing Directions, Tide
Tables, and other Government publications of interest to mariners, may be ob-
tained on request, to the Dominion Hydrographer, Canadian Hydrographic
Service, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa.
For the St. Lawrence Seaway Regulations and Circulars, special equipment, radio
frequencies used in Traffic Control and related information, refer to THE SEAWAY

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast
Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian
List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for informa-
tion not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light
List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Buffalo, N.Y.		KEB-98		162.550 MHz


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within the
areas of the larger scale National Ocean Service 
and Canadian charts are shown thereon and are
not repeated.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by
the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with
additional data from the Corps of Engineers,
Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard and
Canadian authorities.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits indicated are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted
as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore
areas. Mariners should proceed with caution.
