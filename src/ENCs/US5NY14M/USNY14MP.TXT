NOTES:
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light 
structures.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated on this chart. See
Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - IMPROVED CHANNELS
Improved channels shows by broken lines are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
height elevations.

New York, NY		KWO-35	           162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY		WXM-80	           162.475 MHz
 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY
Small craft advisory will be displayed from 
sunrise to sunset from Suffolk County Marine 
Police Patrol Boats under way in the coastal 
and navigable inland waters of Suffolk 
County, Long Island, New York, for boating 
season only.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

NO-DISCHARGE ZONE, 40 CFR 140
This chart falls entirely within the limits of a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ).
Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels 
operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely 
prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or 
untreated, into the waters. All vessels with an installed 
marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, 
anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD 
disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage 
(treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations 
for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. 
Additional information concerning the regulations and 
requirements may be obtained from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/
owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-
ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The National Ocean Service acknowledges the exceptional cooperation received 
from members of the Oyster Bay Power Squadrons, District 3, 
United States Power Squadrons for continually providing essential information 
for revising this chart.
