The hydrography within the heavy dashed black line was 
surveyed by NOS in 2005. A shoaling condition has been 
observed in relation to prior surveys. The density of this 
most recent survey data is inadequate to rule out the pos-
sibility of shoaler depths or undetected submerged features 
in these areas.
