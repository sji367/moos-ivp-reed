AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography (Surveys of 1969) and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional data from the Corps of 
Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard. 


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation. 


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA. 
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details. 


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153). 


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information. 


CAUTION - TEMPORARY 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details, 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart. 


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broad-
casts. The range of reception is variable, but for
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the 
antenna site.
