ATCHAFALAYA BASIN FLOODWAY
Flooding occurs frequently during May and June, at
which time the river overflows its banks and the current
has considerable velocity. Low lying areas throughout
the basin are subject to inundation. These areas may
remain wet and marshy the remainder of the year,
especially along the lakes, rivers, and other drainage.
