NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Only marine radiobeacons have been cali-
brated for surface use.  Limitations on the use 
of certain other radio signals as aids to marine 
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard 
Light Lists and National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


NOTE B
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted 
piles, snags, pumps, and pipes, some submerged 
may exist along the edges of the waterway.
Numerous buoys and signs mark the wing dams, 
along the Sacramento River. Mariners should never 
attempt to pass between the warning buoys and the 
shore.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances are charted as furnished be the Corps of
Engineers. Overhead cable clearances are referred to
high water. Bridge clearances are referred to High Water
(HW) and Low Water (LW).


SACRAMENTO RIVER DEPTHS
Although the soundings depict the general trends in depths, 
they are unreliable because of continual scouring or shoaling due to changing 
river stages. The areas which frequently shoal to the extent that passage of 
vessels drawing over 4 feet is difficult at extreme low water stages are shaded
in purple.
The Federal project provides for a shallow-draft channel, 6 feet deep at low 
water, from Sacramento to Colusa.  The Corps of Engineers conducts annual 
maintenance dredging operations to provide project depth. Consult the District 
Engineer in Sacramento for controlling depths.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio Service station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations. 

Sacramento, CA	 KEC-57	 162.55 MHz WX1


POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers 
shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge 
water within such areas adjacent to domestic 
water intakes as are designated by the Com-
missioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93).  
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supple-
mental information.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the 
Coast Pilot.
