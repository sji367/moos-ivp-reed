AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.   

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice
to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations
may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California
or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of
Engineers in San Francisco, California. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.  

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot for details.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.  

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.  

CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large
commercial and government vessels even if
small craft have the right of way.

CAUTION 
The currents are variable and uncertain,
and tide rips, swirls or eddies may occur in
the Golden Gate and as far eastward as
Alcatraz Island and Raccoon Strait.  

CAUTION 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.  

POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153). 

RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted.  

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.  

BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances are charted as furnished by the Corps of 
Engineers. Overhead cable clearances are referred to high 
water. Bridge clearances are referred to High Water (HW) and 
Low Water (LW).

CAUTION - WARNING CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the 
passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway. 
Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to 
maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the 
result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable 
to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large 
vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.   

Mt.  Pise, CA	KHB-49	 162.400 MHz WX2  

RACING BUOYS 
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon Information may be
obtained from the U.S.  Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all instead in the U.S.  Coast Guard Light List.  

RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in most cases.  
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than twenty meters
in length, shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that
channel. 
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. 
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should
pass port to port. 
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in
most cases. 
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels, when
safe and practicable. 
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete 
text of the Rules of the Road in U.S.  Coast Guard publication
"Navigation Rules".

areas should not be used by vessels 300 gross tons or more, except in case of
emergency or special circumstances.   

TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) 
system in the San Francisco Bay and surrounding areas. Vessels operating 
procedures and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 
CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners should 
consult these sources for applicable rules and reporting requirements. 
Although mandatory VTS participation is limited to the navigable waters of the 
United States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, as a 
condition of port entry to report beyond this area to facilitate advance vessel traffic 
management within the VTS area.
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a Vessel Traffic Service Offshore Vessel 
Movement Reporting System covering the seaward approaches to San Francisco 
Bay. Vessels are requested to monitor VTSSF on Channel 12 at 15 and 45
minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known shipping traffic in the area.
All of the San Pablo Bay is within the VTS area, with the exception of the
Petaluma River Entrance Channel.

VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.
