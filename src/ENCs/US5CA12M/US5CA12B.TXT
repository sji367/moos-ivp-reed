Traffic lanes and the associated precautionary area
established at the approaches to San Francisco Bay are
completely shown on ENC US4CA11M (Chart 18645).
Traffic within the Precautionary Area may consist of
vessels making the transition between the Main Ship
Channel and one of the established traffic lanes. Mariners
are advised to exercise extreme caution when navigating
within this area. The normal cruising area of the pilot
vessel is indicated "PILOT AREA." When passing Traffic
Lane Lighted Buoys "S", "W", or "N", inbound vessels should
contact the pilot boat on Channel 13 for boarding instructions.
