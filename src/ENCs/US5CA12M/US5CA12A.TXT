NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
San Francisco, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
sub marine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception  range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for Stations at
high elevations.

Mt. Pise, CA          KHB-49       162.400 MHz WX2
Mt. Umunhum, CA       KEC-49       162.550 MHz WX1
Mt. Umunhum, CA       WWF-64       162.450 MHz WX5

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system
in the San  Francisco Bay and surrounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and
designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners should consult these sources for
applicable rules and reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS participation
is limited to the navigable waters of the United States, certain vessels are encouraged
or may be required, as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the VTS area.

The U.S. Coast Guard operates a Vessel Traffic Service Offshore Vessel Movement
Reporting System covering the seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay.  Vessels
are requested to monitor VTSSF on Channel 12 at 15 and 45 minutes past each hour
for broadcast reports of known shipping traffic in the area. 

All of San Pablo Bay is within the VTS area with the exception of the Petaluma River
Entrance Channel.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information, see the NOS tide table publication or http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.

NOTE F
Rear range light is a private aid operated for 
ships using the Ninth Avenue Turning Basin only. 
Range serves no purpose for any other transiting 
vessels and should not be used.

NOTE S
Regulations  for Ocean Dumping sites are 
contained in 40 CFR, Parts 220-229. Additional 
information concerning the regulations and re-
quirements for use of the sites may be obtained 
from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
See U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for addresses of 
EPA offices. Dumping subsequent to the survey 
dates may have reduced the depths shown.

ARTICULATED AIDS
An articulated aid to navigation consists of a 
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal 
coupling connected to a sinker. The structure is 
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged 
flotation chamber. It is designed primarily to 
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 60 
feet.All articulated aids are labelled "ART".
