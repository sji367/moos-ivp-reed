NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


COLREGS, 80.738a (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important 
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

San Juan, P.R.  	WXJ-69  	162.40 MHz
St. Thomas, V.I.  	WXM-96  	162.475 MHz


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over
which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and
subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
