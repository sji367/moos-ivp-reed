NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List. 



WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA, or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Concord, MA.

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations
at high elevations.

Meriden, CT	   WXJ-42	162.400 MHz
New York, NY	   KWO-35	162.550 MHz
Riverhead, NY	   WXM-80	162.475 MHz



SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


TIDAL INFORMATION

Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S.

reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
