NOTES:


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the Office of the
District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION  TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated on this chart.
See Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation 
are replaced by other types or removed.
For details see  U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION  LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be 
found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency (NGA) Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject 
to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION  PERIODIC HIGH WATER CONDITIONS
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted as 
visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas.  
Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION  DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION  SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within 
the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are 
required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become 
exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths 
of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION  POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Potable Water Intake (PWI): Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers 
shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent 
to domestic water intakes as are designated bye the Commissioner of Food 
and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93). 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


WARNING  PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids.
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


PLANE OF REFERENCE
(Low Water Datum)..................569.2 ft.
Referred to mean water level at Rimouski, Quebec, 
International Great Lakes Datum (1985).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations.

Sandusky, OH		KHB-97		162.400 MHz
Toledo, OH			WXL-51		162.550 MHz


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead 
clearances are reduced correspondingly. 
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits indicated in magenta are recommended by the 
Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard 
facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning
aids to navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included
in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from 
this chart.
