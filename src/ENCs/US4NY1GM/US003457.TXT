NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 2.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the Office of the
District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if
telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning
aids to navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation
are replaced by other types or removed.
For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within
the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub marine cables are
required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become 
exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths
of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist,
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site,
but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

New London, CT        KHB-47       162.550 MHz
Meriden, CT           WXJ-42       162.400 MHz
Hartford, CT          WXJ-41       162.475 MHz
Riverhead, NY         WXM-80       162.475 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids.
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
Small craft warnings will be displayed from sunrise to sunset from
Suffolk County Marine Police Patrol Boats underway in the coastal
and navigable inland waters of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York:
For boating season only.


CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within the areas of the larger scale
charts are shown thereon and are not repeated.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon.
Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices
as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast
Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey,
and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found
in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject
to error and should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://coops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


COLREGS DEMARCATION LINE (SEE NOTE A)
The Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 is in effect for vessels transiting this area. 
The seaward boundaries of this area are the COLREGS demarcation lines. In the area seaward
of the COLREGS demarcation lines, vessels are governed by COLREGS: International
Regulations for Prevention Collisions at Sea, 1972. The COLREGS demarcation lines are
defined in 33 CFR 80.155b, 33 CFR 80.155c, 33 CFR 80.155d, 33 CFR 80.155e, 33 CFR 80.155f,
33 CFR 80.155g and 33 CFR 80.155h.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS Note:
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.  Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.  Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.
