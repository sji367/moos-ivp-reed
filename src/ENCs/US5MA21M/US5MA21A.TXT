AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 32 to 64
kilometres / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the 
antenna site, but can be as much as 161
kilometres / 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.
