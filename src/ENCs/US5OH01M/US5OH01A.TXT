NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for
information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and
Canadian authorities.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated on this chart. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Akron, OH		KDO-94		162.400 MHz
Cleveland, OH		KHB-59		162.550 MHz
Grafton, OH		WNG-698		162.500 MHz
Sandusky, OH		KHB-97		162.400 MHz                            


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in
statute miles between points of departure.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recom-
mended by the Lake carriers Association and the Canadian
Shipowners Association.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Imagery and Mapping Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.
