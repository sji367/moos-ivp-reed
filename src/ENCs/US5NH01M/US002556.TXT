NOTES:
CAUTION - CURRENTS
General navigation throughout the entire length of the 
Pascataqua River system is severely hampered 
by rapid tidal currents. Velocities vary by location 
due to irregular width, depth, and direction of the river
and tributaries. Hazardous crosscurrents result.  
Navigation of deep-draft vessels is limited to a 3-hour 
period from 1.5 hours before to 1.5 hours after slack water.
Mariners are advised to exercise caution when approaching 
wharfs.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Portland, ME		KDO-95    	162.550 MHz
Boston, MA		KHB-35		162.475 MHz
Concord, NH		WXJ-40		162.400 MHz
Essex Marine, MA	WNG-574		162.425 MHz
Stratham, NH	        KZZ-40		162.450 MHz

AUTHORITIES

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://coops.nos.noaa.gov

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
