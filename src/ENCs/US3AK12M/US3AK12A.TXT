NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notices to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals
are required for fixed mineral development
structures shown, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast
Guard (33 CFR 67).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK		WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Rugged I, AK		WNG-526		162.425 MHz
Ninilchik, AK		KZZ-97      	162.550 MHz
Homer, AK		WXJ-24		162.400 MHz
Soldotna, AK		WWG-39		162.475 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distance from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - LAND UPLIFT
The Cook Inlet Area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-
seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of
21 meters/11.5 fathoms or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this 
uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise
caution.


CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
Significant changes in depths and shoreline
have occurred in the area of this chart as a result
of the earthquake of March 27, 1964.  Tidal
observations since the earthquake indicate
bottom subsidence of -1.6 meters/-5.4 feet at Homer, and
-1.1 meters/-3.7 feet at Seldovia. Mariners are urged to use 
extreme caution when navigating in the area of
this chart as the magnitude of change except at
these sites is not known.


CAUTION
Oil exploration and production operations are
being conducted in the waters of Cook Inlet.
Drilling vessels and movable and permanent
platforms are being used. Only permanent
platforms are charted. Mariners are urged to
exercise caution when transiting the area.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
