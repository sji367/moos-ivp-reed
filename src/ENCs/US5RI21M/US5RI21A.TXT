AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


COLREGS, 80.145
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions of Sea, 1972.
The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted.


SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area. 
Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exists, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed 
below provide continuous marine weather broad-
casts. The range of reception is variable, but for 
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the 
antenna site.
