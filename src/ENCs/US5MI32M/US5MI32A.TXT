NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances
see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S.
Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for
information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Detroit, MI      KEC-63      162.550 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
