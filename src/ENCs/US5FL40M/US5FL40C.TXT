The bascule span is normally in open position, displaying
flashing green signals for water traffic movement. As a train
approaches, signals change to flashing red, siren gives four
blasts, pauses, and repeats four blasts, etc. After an eight (8)
minute delay, the bridge lowers and locks if scanning
equipment reveals nothing under the bridge. When the train has
cleared, the bridge span raises and signals change to flashing
green for water traffic.
