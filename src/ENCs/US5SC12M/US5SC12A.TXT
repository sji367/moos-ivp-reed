NOTES:	
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard District 
in Miami, Fl. or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Charleston, 
SC.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important 
supplemental information.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Charleston, S.C.    KHB-29       162.55 MHz
Beaufort, S.C.      WXJ-23       162.475 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause 
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored 
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual 
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been 
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted 
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. 
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to 
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to 
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the 
nearest United States Coast Guard unit. 


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not open to a full upright or
vertical position, unlimited vertical clearance is not available for the
entire charted horizontal clearance.

CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of Data) are approximate
due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for near shore
navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of
bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of Zone of Confidence in Data) attribute
of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence. Channels
maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are periodically resurveyed
and the quality of data in these channels has not been assessed.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
