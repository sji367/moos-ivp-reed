WARNING PROVISIONAL ENC
This ENC was constructed using the best data available. All or much of the shoreline, depths and shoals within this ENC are below customary quality, are not corrected for tides, nor based on a known sounding datum. All or much of the charted detail is highly changeable. Navigators should use this ENC with extreme caution.

SATELLITE DERIVED DEPTHS
Shoreline, depths, and obstruction areas within the area of this ENC are derived from satellite imagery from 2015.  Their vertical accuracy is typically ± 2m. Uncharted dangers may exist.

SHORELINE DATA
All shoreline data in this ENC cell is to be considered 'Approximate'.
