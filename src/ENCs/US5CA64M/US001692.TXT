RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
local Notice to Mariners.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Santa Barbara, CA	  	KIH-34		162.40 MHz
Santa Barbara Marine, CA	WWF-62		162.475 MHz


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 11th Coast Guard District in Long Beach, California, 
or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers 
in Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Offshore Vessel Traffic Management Recommendations Based on the West Coast Offshore Vessel Traffic Risk Management Project, which was co-sponsored 
by the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force and U.S. Guard Pacific Area, it is 
recommended that, where no other traffic management areas exist such as Traffic Separation Schemes, 
Vessel Traffic Services, or recommended routes, vessels 300 gross tons or larger transiting along the 
coast anywhere between Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 25 
nautical miles offshore. It is also recommended that tank ships laden with persistent petroleum products 
and transiting along the coast between Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay a minimum 
distance of 50 nautical miles offshore. Vessels transiting short distances between adjacent ports should 
seek routing guidance as needed from the local Captain of the Port or VTS authority for that area. This 
recommendation is intended to reduce the potential for vessel groundings and resulting oil spills in the 
event of a vessel casualty.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as
well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
