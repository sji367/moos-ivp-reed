NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography (from surveys of 1949 - 50) and topography by the 
National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional data from the 
State of Alaska, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION  
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers. 

CAUTION - DEPTHS
Depths may vary as much as 6 feet due 
to iceberg groundings.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use
of certain other radio signals as aids to marine
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard
Light List and National Imagery and Mapping
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are advised that in the shallow waters of 
the Beaufort Sea, water levels are strongly influenced 
by meteorological conditions. Strong offshore winds can 
produce water depths up to 0.8 meters (2.6 feet) less 
than those shown.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.

RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS, are 
activated by radars operating on the X-Band, frequencies 
9300 to 9450 MHz and, when activated, will emit an 
international morse code character which will be visible 
on the radar screen that activated the RACON. The 
effective range of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 miles.
The RACONS will be maintained seasonally from 
1 July to 15 September.

COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A) 
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

SUBSISTENCE WHALING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA 
Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in 
subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15 
to October 31. Vessel operators are requested to contact 
the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission at (907) 852-2392, 
or aewcdir@barrow.com prior to entering this area for infor-
mation about the location and avoidance of traditional Native 
hunting parties.
