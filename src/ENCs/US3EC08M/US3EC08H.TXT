The traffic separation scheme is designed to aid in the
prevention of collisions at the approaches to Chesapeake Bay
and does not supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the
Road.

The RECOMMENDED routes for entering and departing
from Chesapeake Bay exist on this product. The
Northeast Approach is centered on a line of fairway buoys 
which separates the courses of inbound and outbound vessels. 
Vessels should leave all buoys on their port hand.

It is RECOMMENDED that the following ships use the
Southern Approach deep-water route when bound for
Chesapeake Bay from sea or to sea from Chesapeake Bay:
Deep-draft ships, drafts defined as 42 feet/12.8 meters or
greater in fresh water, and naval aircraft carriers. Ships
drawing less than 42 feet/ 12.8 meters may use the deep-water
route when, in their master's judgment, the effects of ship
characteristics, its speed, and prevailing environmental
conditions may cause the draft of the ship to equal or exceed
42 feet/12.8 meters.

It is RECOMMENDED that a ship using the deep-water route: 
Announce its intention on VHF-FM channel 16 as it approach-
es Chesapeake Bay Southern Approach Lighted Whistle Buoy
"CB" on the south end, or Chesapeake Bay Entrance Lighted
Whistle Buoy "CH", on the north end of the route:
Avoid, as far as practicable, overtaking other ships operating
in the deep water route;
Keep as near to the outer limit of the route which lies on the
starboard side as is safe and practicable.

All other ships approaching the Chesapeake Bay traffic
separation scheme should use the appropriate inbound or
outbound traffic lane of the traffic separation scheme.

Traffic within the precautionary area may consist of vessels
operating between Thimble Shoal and Chesapeake Channels
and one of the established traffic lanes. Mariners are advised
to exercise extreme care in navigating within this area. The
normal Pilot Boarding Area is bordered by buoys on this product.
