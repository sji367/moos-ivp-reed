One-way traffic lanes overprinted in the vicinity of Smith Point are
RECOMMENDED for all vessels except small craft. They have been designed to aid in
the prevention of collisions but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the
applicable Rules of the Road. The recommended route is marked by a fairway buoy and
a tinted magenta band which separates the courses of inbound and outbound vessels.
Vessels should leave the buoy on their port hand.
