NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway.  Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop.  A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver.  Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels.  Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft operators are warned to beware
of severe water turbulence caused by large
vessels traversing narrow waterways.


CAUTION - ALL CRAFT
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DEPTHS
The depths of water have been determined from conditions existing
prior to the filling of the pool.  Shoaler depths than charted may exist, particularly near the shoreline.

SOUNDING DATUM
Soundings and clearances of bridges and overhead cables in Lower Monumental Reservoir west of
Little Goose Lock and Dam are referred to normal pool elevation of 164.6 meters / 540 feet above mean sea 
level. Soundings in Lake Bryan are referred to 193.5 meters / 635 feet above mean sea level. Normal operating
pool range is between 192.9 meters / 633 feet and 194.5 meters / 638 feet above mean sea level and drawn down to 193.5 meters / 635 feet may occur without prior notice. Vertical clearances for overhead cables and bridges are referred to
the normal pool level of 194.5 meters / 638 feet above mean sea level.
