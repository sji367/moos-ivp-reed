AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any
single aid to navigation, particularly on floating
aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S.
Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.

CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are advised that in the shallow waters of the
Beaufort Sea, water levels are strongly influenced by
meteorological conditions.  Strong offshore winds can
produce water depths up to 0.8 meters (2.6 feet) less than
those shown.

CAUTION - DEPTHS
Depths may vary as much as 1.8 meters (6 feet) due to
iceberg groundings.

RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons or RACONS
are activated by radars operating on the
X-Band frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and
when activated will emit an international morse
code character which will be visible on the
radar screen that activated the RACON. The
effective range of the RACONS will be from 11
to 27 miles.
The RACONS will be maintained seasonally
from 1 July to 15 September.

SUBSISTENCE WHALING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA
Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in
subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15
to October 31. Vessel operators are requested to contact
the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission at (907) 852-2392,
or aewcdir@barrow.com prior to entering this area for infor-
mation about the location and avoidance of traditional Native
hunting parties.
