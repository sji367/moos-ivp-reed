NOTES:
BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits indicated in megenta are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Syracuse, NY	 WXL-31        162.550 MHz (Chan WX-1)
Rochester, NY	 KHA-53        162.400 MHz (Chan WX-2)


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in
statute miles between points of departure.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


AUTHORITIES

with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.
