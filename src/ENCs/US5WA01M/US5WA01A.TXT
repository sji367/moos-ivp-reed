NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S.
Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial and Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


PUGET SOUND HARBOR SAFETY PLAN
The US Coast Guard and the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee have developed
and adopted a Harbor Safety Plan that formally established a set of Standards of Care
for Puget Sound and surrounding waters.  These Standards of Care are intended to
supplement existing regulations by documenting good marine practices for a variety
of operations including tug escorts, pilotage, anchoring, lightering, and provides
additional information on required charts, Aids to Navigation and Emergency Response.
If your vessel does not already have a copy of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Plan,
log on to http://pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or contact the Seattle Marine
Exchange at (206) 443-3830.


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California.  See U.S. Coast Pilot 7 or 8, Chapter 3 for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, U.S.
Coast Guard, and surveys by the Canadian Hydrographic Service.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE C
One-way traffic lanes are RECOMMENDED for use by
all vessels traveling between the points involved.  They have been designated to
aid in the prevention of collisions in the Strait of Juan De Fuca waters, but are
not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the
Road.  Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic
and to be free of ship traffic.  Separation Zones should not be used except
for crossing purposes.  When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones, use
extreme caution.
Precautionary Areas have been established where major lanes merge
and cross the traffic separation scheme.  It is recommended that vessels proceed
with caution in these areas.  Wherever practical, vessels entering or leaving the
system should do so at these precautionary areas.  For more information regarding
Traffic Separation Scheme procedures and regulations, see 33 CFR 167 and / or
chapter 2 of the US Coast Pilot.
For information governing the VESSEL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT AND
INFORMATION SYSTEM for the coastal waters of southern British Columbia,
see National Geospatial and Intelligence Agency Publication 154, Sailing Directions
(enroute) for British Columbia, and the Sailing Directions British Columbia
Coast (South Portion) Volume 1, published by the Canadian Hydrographic
Service.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Neah Bay, WA    	KIH-36		162.550 MHz
Forks, WA           	KXI-27		162.425 MHz


NOTE F
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Service (CVTS) has been
established by the United States and Canada within the
adjoining water in the Juan de Fuca Region. The appropriate
Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Prince Rupert Traffic, Seattle Traffic,
and Victoria Traffic) administers the rules issued by both
nations; however, it will enforce only its own set of rules
within its jurisdiction.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Service (VTS) system in U.S. waters covered by this chart.
Vessel operating procedures and designated radiotelephone
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual.
