AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

San Luis Obispo, CA		KIH-31	     162.550 MHz
Santa Barbara, CA		KIH-34	     162.400 MHz
Santa Barbara Marine, CA 	WWF-62	     162.475 MHz


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral
development structures, subject to approval by the District
Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


CAUTION-SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of.  
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


SUBMERGED SUBMARINE OPERATIONS
Submerged submarine operations are
conducted at various times in the waters contained.
Proceed with caution.
