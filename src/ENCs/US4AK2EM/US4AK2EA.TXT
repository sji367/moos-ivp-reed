NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS) 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder
bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are urged to use caution when navi-
gating in the area of this chart due to possible 
changes in depths and shoreline as a result of
the earthquake of March 27, 1964.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations
	
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Ninilchik, AK		KZZ-97		162.550 MHz
Rugged I, AK		WNG-526		162.425 MHz
Homer, AK		WXJ-24		162.400 MHz
Seward, AK		KEC-81		162.550 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION
An area within the limits of this chart is affected by land uplift due to forces
such as postseismic crustal rebound.  As a result, the tidal datums including
mean lower low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have
changed throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths
of 11 1/2 fathoms or less on this chart were adjusted accordingly, to account for this
uplift, north of latitude 59° 12'. As the uplift rates can only be estimated
and areas continue to rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are
urged to exercise caution.


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
