AUTHORITIES: Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, 
Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, and other sources.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION: Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental 
information concerning aids to navigation.  

NOTE A: Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the 
Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of 
the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.

NOTE B: Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the 
waters contained on this chart. Proceed with caution. 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER: The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any 
single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard 
Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS: Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest 
U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION: Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  
See Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION: Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation 
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject 
to error and should be used with caution.

CAUTION - Submarine Pipelines and Cables: Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist 
within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines 
and submarine 
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried 

may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when 
operating vessels in 
depths of water comparable to their draft in areas 
where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging or 
trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

RADAR REFLECTORS: Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.
