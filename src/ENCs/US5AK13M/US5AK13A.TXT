NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - THE COOK INLET
The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-seismic crustal rebound.  As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed throughout this region.  Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 11.5 fathoms or less on this chart were adjusted accordingly to account for this uplift.  As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise caution.


CAUTION
Oil exploration and production operations are being conducted in the waters of Cook Inlet.
Drilling vessels and movable and permanent platforms are being used.  Only permanent platforms are charted.  Mariners are urged to exercise caution when transiting the area.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral development structures shown on this chart, subject to approval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.
	
Bede Mt, AK      WNG-528     162.450 MHz
Raspberry I, AK  KZZ-90      162.425 MHz 
Ninilchik, AK    KZZ-97      162.550 MHz
Soldotna, AK     WWG-39      162.475 MHz
Homer, AK        WXJ-24      162.400 MHz
	

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The Entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot
