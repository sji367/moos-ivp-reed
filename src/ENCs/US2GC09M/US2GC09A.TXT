NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4 and 5.Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.Information concerning he regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, FL, and 8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, FL,Mobile,AL or New Orleans, LA. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar  reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral development structures, subject to approval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


OFFSHORE NAVIGATION
For offshore navigation only. Detail within the 18.2 meter/10 fathom curve is not shown on this chart except on a offlying shoals.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


CAUTION - FISH HAVENS
Numerous uncharted fish havens, some marked by privately maintained buoys, exist seaward of the 18.2 meters/10-fathom curve. See larger scale charts for location.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov
 
HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from charted positions, damaged, sunk extinguished  or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations.  Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and  are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

GAS AND OIL WELL STRUCTURES
Numerous platforms and gas and oil well structures exist in the water areas from Key West, Florida, to Brazos Santiago, Texas. Some wells are submerged and capped. Only those structures reported submerged of unknown depth and submerged structures covered less than 20.1 meters/11 fathoms are charted outside of the 18.2 meter/10 fathom curve. See charts in the 1:400,000 scale range and 1:80,000 scale series charts for location of surface platform structures, surface wells, and wells submerged 20.1 meters/11 fathoms or more, submarine pipelines and cables, aids to navigation and safety fairways through oil fields.

CONTIGUOUS ZONE
The Contiguous Zone is a zone contiguous to the territorial sea, in which the United States may exercise the control necessary to prevent and punish infringement within its territory or territorial sea of its customs, fiscal, immigration, cultural heritage or sanitary laws and regulations. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
