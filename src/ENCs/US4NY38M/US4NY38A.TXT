NOTES:

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for
information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 and Canadian Sailing Directions, Great Lakes, Vol. 1
for important supplemental information.
Information concerning Canadian Nautical Charts, Sailing Directions, Tide Tables 
and other Government publications of interest to mariners may be obtained on 
request to the Dominion Hydrographer, Canadian Hydrographic Service, Department 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa.
For the St. Lawrence Seaway Regulations and Circulars, special equipment, radio 
frequencies used in Traffic Control and related information, refer to THE SEAWAY
HANDBOOK.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and
Canadian authorities.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual
radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna
site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.
Buffalo, NY		KEB-98		162.550 MHz
Erie, PA		KEC-58		162.400 MHz 
Meadville, PA   	KZZ-32    	162.475 MHz 


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing struc-
tures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures
are not charted unless known to be permanent.


CAUTION - GAS PIPELINES AND WELLS
Gas pipelines and wells contain natural gas under pressure and damage to
these installations would create an immediate fire hazard. Vessels anchoring in
Lake Erie should do so with caution after noting the underwater, and therefore
concealed, positions of all oil and gas wells, pipelines, submerged cables and
other installations.


CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers
shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge
water within such areas adjacent to domestic
water intakes as are designated by the Com-
missioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93). 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supple-
mental information.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances
see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits indicated in magenta are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are
in statute miles between points of departure.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.
