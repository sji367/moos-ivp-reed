NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.  Additions 
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information 
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast 
Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps 
of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center 
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if 
telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at nauticalcharts.gov


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS tide table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Notice 
to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation 
are replaced by other types or removed.  For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed below provide continuous marine weather 
broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 
to 40 miles from the antenna site.


Sandusky, OH		KHB-97		162.400 MHz
Adrian, MI              WNG-647         162.450 MHZ
Detroit, MI		KEC-63		162.550 MHz
Toledo, OH		WXL-51		162.550 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of certain radio signals as aids to marine navigation 
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List and National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to 
error and should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly 
on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the 
area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to 
be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners 
should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to 
their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, 
or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NO-DISCHARGE ZONE
Michigan waters of Lakes Michigan, Huron, Superior, Erie and St. Clair, all waterways 
connected thereto, and all inland lakes are designated as a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ).  
Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels operating within a No-Discharge 
Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, 
into the waters.  Commercial vessel sewage shall include graywater.  All vessels with 
an installed marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or 
docked within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of 
sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank.  Regulations for the NDZ are 
contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot.  Additional information concerning the regulations 
and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) web 
site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/vessel_sewage/vsdnozone.html.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are 
reduced correspondingly.
For clearances see U.S.Coast Pilot 6.


BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not open to a full upright or vertical position,
unlimited vertical clearance is not available for the entire charted horizontal 
clearance.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.
