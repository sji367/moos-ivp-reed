NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation. 
See Canadian List of Lights Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast
Guard Light List.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.
Aids to Navigation will be maintained seasonally
from 1 July to 1 November.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

CAUTION - RADIO NAVIGATIONAL AIDS
Radio navigational aids on the Russian Arctic
coast and adjacent islands north of the Arctic
Circle have been omitted due to the lack
of reliable information.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.

CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are advised that in the shallow waters of
the Beaufort Sea, water levels are strongly
influenced by meteorological conditions. Strong
offshore winds can produce water depths up to 
0.8 meters (2.6 feet) less than those shown.

RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS are 
activated by radars operating on the X-Band
frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHZ, and when
activated will emit an international morse code
character which will be visible on the radar screen
that activated the RACON. The effective range
of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 miles.
The RACONS will be maintained seasonally
from 1 July to 15 September.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUBSISTENCE WHALING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA
Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in
subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15
to October 31. Vessel operators are requested to contact
the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission at (907) 852-2392,
or aewcdir@barrow.com prior to entering this area for infor-
mation about the location and avoidance of traditional Native
hunting parties.

MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are
required for fixed mineral development structures
shown, subject to approval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard
(33 CFR 67).

COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian Hydrographic Service.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted.
