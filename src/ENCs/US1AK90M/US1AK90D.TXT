A study by the Canadian authorities within the
dashed outlined area indicates hazardous pinnacle-
like features which may reduce the depths to as
little as 30 percent of the charted depth. For example,
where a depth of 29.26 meters/16 fathoms is charted, a depth of
8.68 meters/4.75 fathoms may exist nearby. An echo sounder
may provide little if any warning when approaching
these features.
