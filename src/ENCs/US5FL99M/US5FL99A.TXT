NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 4 & 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, 
Florida. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS 
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations. 
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. 
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved. 
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio Station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Key West, FL	WXJ-95		162.400 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace
as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


COLREGS, 80.740 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CORAL PROPAGATION
Uncharted submerged manmade structures, designed for the purpose of coral propagation, may exist within the limits of this chart,
principally in shallow water areas.
