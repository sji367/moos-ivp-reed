NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Traverse City, MI	KIH-22		162.400 MHz (Chan WX-2)
Hesperia, MI		WWF-36		162.470 MHz (Chan WX-3)


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above 
Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.


CAUTION - DUE TO PERIODIC
Due to periodic high water conditions in the 
Great Lakes, some features charted as visible 
at Low Water Datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should 
proceed with caution.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in chapter 2 U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard Districts in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
