Recommended two way routes have been established including deep-water routes for
vessels in the approaches to Portland Harbor and Casco Bay, through Hussey Sound to
Cousins Island and through Broad Sound to Harpswell, Maine. While not mandatory, deep
draft commercial vessels (including tugs and barges) are requested to follow the designated
routes at the masters's discretion. Other vessels, while not excluded from these routes, should
exercise caution in and around these areas and monitor VHF Channel 16 or 13 for information
concerning deep draft commercial vessels (including tugs and barges) transiting these routes.
