Extreme caution should be exercised while navigating in
this area of this chart.  The bottom is subject to constant
change and shoaling, especially near river entrances.  In
addition, mirage often distorts the appearance of the land
and greatly reduces the dependability of positions obtained
by astronomic sights.
