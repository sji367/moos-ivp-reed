NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the 
nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in theU.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations 
are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or revisions to chapter 2 are published in the
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard 
District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Geological Survey and U.S. Coast Guard.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids 
has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 
40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Nome. Ak		WXJ-62		162.550 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see Note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS demarcation line.


MAGNETIC VARIATION
Magnetic variation curves are for 2015 derived from 2015 World Magnetic Model and accompanying secular change. If annual change is 
in same direction as variation it is additive and the variation is increasing. If annual change is opposite in direction to 
variation it is subtractive and the variation is decreasing.
