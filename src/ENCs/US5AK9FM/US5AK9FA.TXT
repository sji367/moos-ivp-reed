revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SHALLOW WATERS 
Mariners are advised that in the shallow waters of 
the Beaufort Sea, water levels are strongly influenced 
by meteorological conditions.  Strong offshore winds 
can produce water depths up to 0.8 meters (2.6 feet) 
less than those shown.


CAUTION - DEPTHS
Depths may vary as much as 6 feet due 
to iceberg groundings.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)

Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in 
subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15 
to October 31.  Vessel operators are requested to contact

or aewcdir@barrow.com prior to entering this area for infor-
mation about the location and avoidance of traditional Native
