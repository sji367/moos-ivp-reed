WARNING - PRELIMINARY CHART
The soundings in this area are considered to be of marginal quality for modern charts.
Continuous bottom profiles were not taken between soundings, and spacing between soundings
is wide enough to allow hazards to remain undetected. Navigators should use caution in 
this area and report discrepancies or hazards to the Director, Office of Coast Survey,
(N/CS), National Ocean Service, NOAA, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.
