NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast
Guard, and National Geospatial-intelligence Agency.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be
found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are
subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
San Francisco, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. Information 
may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other 
privately maintained buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling,
particularly at the edges.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual 
radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.

NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the San Francisco Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessels operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the
VTS area.

The U.S. Coast Guard operates a Vessel Traffic Service
Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System covering the
seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay. Vessels are
requested to monitor VTSSF on Channel 12 at 15 and 45
minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known
shipping traffic in the area.


ARTICULATED AIDS
An articulated aid to navigation consists of a
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal
coupling connected to a sinker. The structure is
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged
flotation chamber. It is designed primarily to 
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 18.2 meters/60 
feet. 


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning
aids to navigation.
