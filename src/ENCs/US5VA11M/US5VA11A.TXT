SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilots 3 and 4 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data 
from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, 
U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilots 3 and 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are 
published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Norfolk, Virginia. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - FISH TRAP AREAS AND STRUCTURES
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted 
duck blinds and fishing structures, some sub-
merged, may exist in the fish trap areas. Such 
structures are not charted unless known to be 
permanent. 
Regulations to assure clear passage to and 
through dredged and natural channels and to 
established landings are prescribed by the Corps 
of Engineers in the Code of Federal Regulations. 
Definite limits of fish trap areas have been 
established in some areas. 
Where definite limits have not been prescribed, 
the location of fishing structures is restricted only 
by the regulations.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines
and submarine cables may exist within the area
of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and
submarine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have be-
come exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of water
comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exists, and when anchoring, drag-
ging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or un-
lighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
