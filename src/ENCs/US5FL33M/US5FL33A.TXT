AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light list
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States. For Information
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, Post Office
Box 30423, Raleigh, N.C. 27612, 919-821-0281
SUCGAUX- 7th Coast Guard District, 51 Southwest Ave., Miami,FL 33130
305-350-5697 or USCG headquarters (G-BAU), Washington, D.C. 20593-0001.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


ARTICULATED AIDS
An articulated aid to navigation consists of a
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal
coupling connected to a sinker. The structure is
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged
flotation chamber. It is designed primarily to
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 60
feet. All articulated aids are labeled “Art”.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

West Palm Beach, FL	              KEC-50		              162.475 MHz

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the appropriate is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway
southward from Norfolk, VA to Cross Bank in
Florida Bay, aids with yellow triangles should
be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and
aids with yellow squares should be kept on the
port side of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


WEATHER RULES FOR SAFE BOATING
Before setting out:
1. Check local weather and sea conditions.
2.Obtain the latest weather forecast for your area from radio broadcasts.
when warnings are in effect, don't go out unless you are confident your
boat can be navigated safely under forecast conditions of wind and sea. Be
clubs, marinas, and at other coastal points.
While afloat:
1.Keep a weather eye out for:
A. A sudden vertical cumulus cloud development
B. A sudden change in wind direction
C. A sudden noticeable increase in wind velocity
D. A drop in temperature
2. Be alert to heavy static on your AM radio which may indicate approaching
thunderstorms.
3.Check radio weather broadcasts for forecasts and warnings.
Thundersqualls often occur on warn, moist afternoons and are a great
hazard to the mariner. They can have wind gusts up to 80 mph and hit almost
without warning. To survive a squall, you must prevent being capsized or blown
to leeward into danger.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


NOTE S
Regulations for Ocean Dumping Sites are
contained in 40 CFR, Parts 220-229.  Additional
information concerning the regulations and re-
quirements for use of the sites may be obtained
from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
See U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for addresses of
EPA offices. Dumping subsequent to the survey
dates may have reduced the depths shown.


Administration Area
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
