SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to 
the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communi-
cation is impossible (33 CFR 153).

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supple-
mental information concerning aids to navigation.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S. 
Coast Guard.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Sacramento, CA		KEC-57		162.55 MHz WX1
Mt. Pise, CA		KHB-49		162.40 MHz WX2


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject 
to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating 
aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-
ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area  
covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which
