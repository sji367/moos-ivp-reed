NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the United States National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the
United States Corps of Engineers and United States Coast
Guard.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest 
United States Coast Guard facility if tele-
phone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult United States Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  
See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 
List of Lights and Fog Signals for information 
not included in the United States Coast Guard 
Light List.


CAUTION - LARGER SCALE CHARTS
Danger, Prohibited, and Restricted Areas falling
within the limits of the larger scale charts are shown
thereon and not repeated.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines
and submarine cables may exist within the 
area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables are required to be
buried, and those that were originally buried 
may have become exposed.  Mariners should
use extreme caution when operating vessels in 
depths of water comparable to their draft in
areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE
Recommended traffic lanes established in Prince
William Sound are shown on NOS charts 16707, 16708, 16709
and 16700.


MAGNETIC VARIATION
Magnetic variation curves are for 2015 derived from
2015 World Magnetic Model and accompanying secular
change.  If annual change is in same direction as variation
it is additive and the variation is increasing. If annual
change is opposite in direction to variation it is subtractive 
and the variation is decreasing.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information, see the NOS tide table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.
