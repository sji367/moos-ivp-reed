NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communcations impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland , Ohio or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Detroit, Michigan. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in statute miles between points of departure.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearancessee U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. SeeLocal Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE (PWI)
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent to domestic water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
(21 CFR 1250.93).
Consult U.S. Coast pilot 6 for important supplemental information.



AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.
