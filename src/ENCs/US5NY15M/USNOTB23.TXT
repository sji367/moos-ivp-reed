The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the New York Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated 
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners 
should consult these sources for applicable rules and 
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United 
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, 
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to 
facilitate vessel traffic management within the VTS area.
