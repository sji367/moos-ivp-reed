NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Wilmington, North Carolina.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important 
supplemental information.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers /
20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can 
be as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for 
stations at high elevations.

Norfolk, VA		KHB-37		162.55 MHz
Mamie, NC		WWH-26		162.425 MHz
Cape Hatteras, NC	KIG-77		162.475 MHz


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the approximate charts is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway
Southward from Norfolk, VA to Cross Bank in
Florida Bay, aids with yellow triangles should
be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and
aids with yellow squares should be kept on the
port side of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices 
and structures such as fish traps, pound nets, 
crab traps, and duck blinds, some submerged, 
may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in 
the nearshore area. Mariners should proceed 
with caution.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause 
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored 
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been 
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted 
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. 
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to 
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the 
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light 
structures shown.
