NOTES:
CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation. 
See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 
List of Lights and Fog Signals for information 
not included in the United States Coast Guard 
Light List. 


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LARGE SCALE CHARTS
Danger, Prohibited, and Restricted Areas 
falling within the limits of the larger scale 
charts are shown thereon and not reported.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE OPERATING AREAS
Submerged Submarine Operating Areas 
falling within the limits of the larger scale 
charts are shown thereon and not repeated.


SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within 
the area. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be 
buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.Mariners 
should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable
to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring,
dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian Hydrographic Service.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
