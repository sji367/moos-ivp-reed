NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Baltimore, Maryland.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 3 for important
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light
structures.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigations can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices
and structures such as fish traps, pound nets,
crab traps, and duck blinds, some submerged,
may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in
the near shore area. Mariners should proceed
with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Baltimore, MD     KEC-83    162.400 MHz
Salisbury, MD     KEC-92    162.475 MHz
Lewes, DE         WXJ-94    162.550 MHZ
Sudlersville,MD   WXK-97    162.500 MHz


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small-craft
warnings will be displayed from sunrise to
sunset on Maryland Marine Police Cruisers
while underway in Maryland waters of the
Chesapeake Bay and tributaries.


CAUTION - BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not
open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited
vertical clearance is not available for the entire
charted horizontal clearance.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


OYSTER AQUACULTURE
Oyster bed aquaculture leases may exist within the limits of
this chart. Mariners are cautioned that numerous markers
may exist and watermen may be active in the area. Caution
should be exercised when navigating in or near these areas,
not to anchor or ground, in order to avoid damage to the
beds. Depths may be shallower than the soundings shown.
For more information, contact the local department of natural
resources.
