WARNING
The hydrography on this preliminary chart is of varying degrees of quality. In the areas of sparse soundings many of the depths were taken by lead line in the early 1900's,so further uncharted shoals are likely. The depths in the area of dense soundings were acquired by modern survey methods. Navigators should use this chart with extreme caution and report discrepancies or hazards to the Cheif, Marine Chart Division(N/CG22), National Ocean service, NOAA, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910. This preliminary chart is distributed as an interim product while modern surveys are being conducted. Each winter for the next several years a new edition will be published showing the unverified data collected the previous summer. When all surveys are completed, a final chart meeting modern charting standards will be published.
