CAUTION  USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.

CAUTION  DEPTHS
Depths may vary as much as 6 feet due to iceberg groundings.

RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS, are activated by radars operating on the X-band, frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and, when activated will emit an international morse code character which will be visible on the radar screen that activated the RACON. Then effective range of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 miles.
The RACONS will be maintained seasonally from 1 July to 15 September.

TIDAL INFORMATION
