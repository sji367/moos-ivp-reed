One-way traffic lanes are overprinted RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels traveling be-
tween the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to
Portland Harbor and the approach to Boston Harbor and for routing traffic through the Bay of Fundy but are
not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. Separation zones are intended
to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to be free of ship traffic. Separation zones should not be used
except for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution.
The recommended route in the Bay of Fundy has been established by the Department of Transport, Canada.
See large scale Canadian charts.
