The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-
seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower 
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed 
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 
21.03 meters/69 feet or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this 
uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to 
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise 
caution.
