AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
San Francisco, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations. 
Mt. Pise, CA		KHB-49		162.40 MHz WX2

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

NOTE B
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the San Francisco Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated 
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS user's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond to
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the
VTS area.
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a Vessel Traffic Service
Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System covering the
seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay. Vessels are
requested to monitor VTSSF on Channel 12 at 15 and 45
minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known shipping traffic in the area.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as 
well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
