One-way traffic lanes are 
RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels traveling between 
the points involved. They have been designed to aid in 
the prevention of collisions at the approaches to San 
Francisco Bay but are not intended in any way to supersede 
or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. Separation 
zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound 
traffic and to be free of ship traffic. Separation zones 
should not be used except for crossing purposes. When 
crossing traffic lanes and separation zones, use extreme 
caution.

Portions of the traffic separation scheme 
have been amended by the IMO. See IMO COLREG.2/Circ.64. 
Please be advised that these portions have not been revised by 
the United States Coast Guard and that the corresponding 
changes have not been updated in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (33 CFR part 167). There are differences between 
the two traffic separation schemes and caution is advised.
