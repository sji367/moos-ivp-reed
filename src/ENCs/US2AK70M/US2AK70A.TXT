NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See Notice to Mariners.


LOCAL MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE
Differences of as much as 10° from the normal
variation may be expected within the limits of
this chart.


MAGNETIC VARIATION
Magnetic variation curves for 2015 are derived from 
2015 World Magnetic model and accompanying secular 
change. If annual change is in same direction as variation 
it is additive and the variation is increasing.  If annual 
change is opposite in direction to variation it is subtractive 
and the variation is decreasing.
