NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilots 2&3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are 
published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
New York, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the New York Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated 
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners 
should consult these sources for applicable rules and 
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United 
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, 
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to 
facilitate vessel traffic management within the VTS area.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS  
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.



CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 and 3 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFELCTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
