NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilots 2&3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
New York, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS  
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S 
Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting station are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RACING BUOYS
Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 and 3 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION _ MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the protective riprap surrounding navigational light structures.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  
Not all submarine pipelines and sub-marine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFELCTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://coops.nos.noaa.gov


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.  Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.  Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.
