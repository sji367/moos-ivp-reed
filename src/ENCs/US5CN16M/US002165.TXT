NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-

mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Meriden, CT		WXJ-42		162.40 MHz
New London, CT		KHB-47		162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY		WXM-80		162.475 MHz


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
Supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners. 
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area. 
Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon, Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - RIPRAP
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light 
structures.
