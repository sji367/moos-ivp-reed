RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

ADMINISTRATION AREA

Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial 
sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to 
the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer 
to the Coast Pilot.
