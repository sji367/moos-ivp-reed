AIDS TO NAVIGATION: Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.  

NOTE A: Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, Mass, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in New York, New York. Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers.  

WARNING – PRUDENT MARINER: The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS: Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

Champlain Canal and Hudson River to Troy N.Y. are covered in more detail on small craft Chart 14786.

CAUTION: Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed.  For details, see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION: Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Imagery and Mapping Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution. RADAR REFLECTORS: Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.

SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES: Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exists, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS: The NOAA Weather Radio station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.
