NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

 

POLLUTION REPORTS

Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).




SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental
information.




CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES

Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.



CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM

Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in
the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with caution.




CAUTION - LIMITATIONS

Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.





BRIDGES AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES

When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS

The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.




NOTE A

Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulation may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, Mass., or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
New York, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
