NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see  U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed 
with caution.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist in federal channels.
CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service,
Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Newberry, MI		WNG-576		162.450 MHz
Sault Ste Marie, MI	KIG-74		162.550 MHz


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearing of sailing courses are true and distances given
thereon are in statute miles between points of departure


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by 
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.

NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.
