A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system
has been established by the United States and Canada
within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region.
The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Tofino Traffic,
Seattle Traffic, Victoria Traffic) administers the rules
issued by both nations, however, it will enforce only its
own set of rules within its jurisdiction.
