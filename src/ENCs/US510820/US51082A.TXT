POSITIONS:
This cell has been positioned on the WGS-84 Datum through the use of a Rectified Ortho-photo.

LIDAR SURVEYS:
Areas of this chart have been surveyed with the airborne CHARTS LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system. LIDAR is an accepted method of rapid hydrographic survey of coastal areas which meets International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards for accuracy, quality and hazard detection. LIDAR, which has a maximum seabed detection limit of approximately 40 meters is affected by environmental factors such as water clarity (turbidity), sea state and sun angle. Such environmental factors present at the time of data collection may limit the range or geographic extents of soundings gathered by the system. In such cases, LIDAR data may have been augmented by other sources in the construction of this chart.

CAUTION:
Due to the earthquake of January 2010, aids to navigation and charted landmarks may be unreliable. There may be floating debris, oil spills, and underwater obstructions that may not be plotted in this cell. Not all ruins and dangers are marked or known. The navigator should use extreme caution when navigating this cell.
