NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the 
Commander, 8th Coast Guard District in New 
Orleans, LA, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Galveston, TX.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


AUTHORITIES

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological  
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.  
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. 
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable. 
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules".


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way. 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SURVEY PLATFORMS
Survey platforms, signs, pipes, piles, and 
stakes, some submerged, may exist along the 
maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not 
charted where they interfere with a light symbol.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS

(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information 
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storm. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. 
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved. 
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY - AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use
with nautical charts, and the exact meaning of an aid to
navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart is
consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway
exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids
marking other waterways. 
When following the Intracoastal Waterway westward from
Carrabelle, Florida to Brownsville, Texas, aids with yellow
triangles should be kept on the starboard side of the vessel
and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side
of the vessel.  
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information,
but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the
Intracoastal Waterway.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
 Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace
as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
