AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations
at high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK		WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Kodiak, AK		WXJ-78		162.550 MHz
Cape Gull, AK		WNG-529		162.500 MHz 
Marmot Island, AK	WNG-716		162.500 MHz
Sitkinak Dome, AK	WNG-718 	162.450 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.	


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California.  See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - TIDAL
Tidal observations made by the National Ocean Service
since the earthquake of March 27, 1964, indicate bottom
subsidence at the following location:

      Subsidence (feet)
Womens Bay		-5.6
Lazy Bay		-0.6
Larsen Bay		-2.5
Uganik Bay		-3.7
Kodiak			-5.8

Mariners are cautioned to expect shoaling or deepening
for the areas listed.  Tidal observations at this time are at
selected sites and the magnitude of the changes except
at these sites is not known.


CAUTION - CHANGES IN BUOYAGE
Mariners are advised that authorized aids to navigation are being changed to
conform to maritime standards of the International Association of Lighthouse
Authorities Maritime Buoyage System, Region B. Significant changes are: black
port hand buoys to green; black and white vertically striped buoys to red and white
vertically striped buoys; and lateral lights from white to red or green as appropriate.
Changes to aids to navigation will be announced in the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency weekly Notice to Mariners and the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice
to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
