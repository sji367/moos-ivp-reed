The two-way routes shown are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels
traveling into or out of Cape Cod Bay. This routing has been established to reduce
the likelihood of ship strikes of endangered North Atlantic right whales. Mariners are
warned that some vessels might not be able to keep to the starboard side of the
route at all times. CAUTION: Full bottom coverage surveys have not been conducted
within the entire route, so uncharted dangers may exist. See Chapter 1, U.S. Coast Pilot.
