NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in Mobile, AL.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the 
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous marine weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than 19.8 meters/ 65 feet
in length, shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that
channel.

A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should
pass port to port.

When motorboats approach each other at right angles or
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most
cases.

Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when
safe and practicable.

Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text
of the Rules of the Road in the U.S. Coast Guard publication
"Navigation Rules".


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small
vessels.  Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the appropriate chart is consulted. 

Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.

When following the Intracoastal Waterway
westward from Carrabelle, FL to Brownsville, TX,
aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the
starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow
squares should be kept on the port side of the
vessel.

A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.

All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - GAS AND OIL WELL STRUCTURES
Uncharted platforms, gas and oil well struc-
tures, pipes, piles and stakes can exist within
the limits of this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast 
Pilot for details.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary 
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information 
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:

USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, 1504 Blue Ridge 
Road, Raleigh, NC 27607, 888-367-8777

USCGAUX - COMMANDER (OAX), Eighth Coast Guard District, Hale Boggs 
Federal Building, Suite 1126, 500 Poydras Street, New Orleans, LA 70130, 
800-524-8835 or USCG Headquarters, Office of the Chief Director (G-OCX), 2100 
Second Street, SW, Washington, DC 20593


SEDIMENT TRAPS
Sediment traps are designed to delay shoaling of the navigable portion of a 
channel by trapping advancing littoral material. Sediment traps may shoal at a 
rapid rate spilling over into the adjacent navigation channel, therefore, mariners 
should exercise caution when operating near them.
