NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


STATUTE MILES - COLUMBIA RIVER AND WILLAMETTE RIVERS
Mileage distances along the Columbia and Willamette
Rivers are in Statute Miles. Distances along the Columbia
River are eastward from the mouth, and along the Willamette
River are southward from the junction of the Columbia River.
Tables for converting Statute Miles to International Nautical 
Miles are given in Coast Pilot 7.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


TIDES
The diurnal range of the Vancouver (46°37'N/122°40'W) during 
low river stages is 0.5 meters/1.8 feet. The range becomes 
progressively smaller with higher stages of the river. Apr 2016


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Portland, OR     KIG-98    162.550 MHz
Woodland, WA     WNG-604   162.525 MHz


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.



TIDAL INFORMATION
