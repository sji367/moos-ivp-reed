NOTES:

AUTHORITIES

with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey,
and U.S. Coast Guard.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. 
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE D
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times
in the waters contained on this chart.
Proceed with caution. 


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard
facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists
and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting
stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning
aids to navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINE AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist
within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried
may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating
vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


WEST COAST OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC RISK MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Vessels 272 metric tons / 300 gross tons or larger transiting along the coast anywhere between
Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 46 kilometers / 25
nautical miles offshore.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio Service stations listed below provide
continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically
37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

San Diego, Calif.          KEC-62       162.40 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions.
These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted
features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist
in federal channels.
