CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
 Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - HEAVY TIDES
Extremely heavy tide rips and strong currents, 
which at times make control of vessel difficult, 
may be encountered in the passages between 
the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea.
See Tidal Current Tables for supplemental 
information.


CAUTION - UNCHARTED ROCKS
Numerous uncharted rocks may exist shore-
ward of the 10 meter curve.

to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
