The mud flat in front of Taku Glacier is expanding rapidly 
to the southwest. Nineteen ninety-seven survey data reveal 
that extensive shoaling has occurred from Jaw Point to 
Davidson Point and is expected to continue. Passage 
through this area should not be attempted without local 
knowledge.
