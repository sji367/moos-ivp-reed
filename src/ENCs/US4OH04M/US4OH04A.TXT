NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and
Canadian authorities.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous
uncharted stakes and fishing structures,
some submerged, may exist in the area of
this chart. Such structures are not charted
unless known to be permanent.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to Periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations. 

Grafton, OH		WNG-698		162.500 MHz
Cleveland, OH		KHB-59		162.550 kHz
Akron, OH		KDO-94		162.400 kHz
Sandusky, OH		KHB-59		162.400 kHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 and Canadian Sailing Directions, Great Lakes,
Vol. 1 for important supplemental information.
Information concerning Canadian Nautical Charts, Sailing Directions, Tide
Tables, and other Government publications of interest to mariners, may be
obtained on request to the Dominion Hydrographer, Canadian Hydrographic
Service, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa.
For the St. Lawrence Seaway Regulations and Circulars, special equipment,
radio frequencies used in Traffic Control and related information, refer to
THE SEAWAY HANDBOOK.


CAUTION - GAS PIPELINES AND WELLS
Gas pipelines and wells contain natural gas under pressure and damage to these
installations would create an immediate fire hazard. Vessels anchoring in Lake Erie
should do so with caution after noting the underwater, and therefore concealed,
positions of all oil and gas wells, pipelines, submerged cables and other installa-
tions.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot 6 for details.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances
given thereon are in statute miles(St M) and nautical miles (NM) between
points of departure. The true bearing between any two points on this
chart may be determined by connecting the two points with a straight
line and measuring the angle of its intersection with a meridian line.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing Courses and limits are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.
