POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY DEPTH	
12 feet/3.6 meters, Carabelle, FL to Brownsville, TX.
The controlling depths are published periodically
in the U.S. Coast  Guard Local Notice to Mariners.
Uncharted shoals may exist in areas which have
not been recently surveyed. Please report shoals
and obstructions at:
http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/staff/contact.htm


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States.  For information
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:


CAUTION - WARNING CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway.  Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop.  A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver.  Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels.  Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
naulical miles from the anlenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations

Pensacola, FL	KEC-86	162.400 MHz
Panama City, FL	KCG-67	162.550 MHz

RACING BUOYS 
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all instead in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway
westward from Carrabelle, FL to Brownsville, TX,
aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the
starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow
squares should be kept on the port side of the
vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway. 


CAUTION - HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.

CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.
