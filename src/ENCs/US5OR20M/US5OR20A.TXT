AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in 
Seattle, Washington, or at the Office of the
District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Portland,
Oregon.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S.
Coast Guard.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - THE DEPTHS OF WATER
The depths of water within the pool area have been
determined from conditions existing prior to the filling of
the pool. Shoaler depths than charted may exist within the
blue tint area particularly near the shoreline.  The areas outlined
by the dotted curve and tinted green indicate depths of 1 
foot or less when the pool elevation is 48.1 meters/160 feet at the Dalles
dam forebay.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over 
which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and 
subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

SOUNDING DATUM
Soundings and clearances of bridges and overhead cables refer to normal pool elevation, which is 160 feet
above mean sea level in the upper pool above The Dalles Dam.
