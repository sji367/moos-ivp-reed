An articulated aid to navigation consists of a 
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal 
coupling connected to a sinker. The structure is 
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged 
flotation chamber. It is designed primarily to 
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 18.2 meters/60 feet. 
All articulated aids are labeled "Art".
