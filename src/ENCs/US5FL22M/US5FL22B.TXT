Cross-channel current variations in Government Cut are particularly
difficult to negotiate because of variances between predicted
and actual currents. Caution should be exercised when entering from sea
during flood tide with northeasterly winds; a strong turning torque
occurs when just inside the north jetty. A similar but less serious
situation occurs when leaving the port during ebb tides. Horizontal
current gradients occur in the turning basin at the northwest corner of
Dodge Island which may make maneuvering difficult. Ships may
encounter current anomalies at the mouth of the Miami River.
