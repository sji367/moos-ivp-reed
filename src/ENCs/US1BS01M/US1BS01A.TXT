NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Japanese Hydrographic Department.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - DANGER
Danger, Prohibited, and Restricted Areas
falling within the limits of the larger scale
charts are shown thereon and not repeated..


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines
and submarine cables may exist within the 
area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables are required to be
buried, and those that were originally buried 
may have become exposed.  Mariners should
use extreme caution when operating vessels in 
depths of water comparable to their draft in
areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
