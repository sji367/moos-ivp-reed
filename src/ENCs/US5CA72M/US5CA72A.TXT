NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California, or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Department 
of the Navy and U.S. Coast Guard.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

CAUTION - FLEET MOORING
Fleet mooring multiple anchors may protrude 
one to four feet above the surrounding bottom to 
a radius of 225 feet from each mooring depend-
ing on hard bottom conditions.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor
navigation conditions. These surveys are not
intended to detect underwater features.
Uncharted features hazardous to surface
navigation are not expected but may exist
in federal channels.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - SUBMERGED SUBMARINE OPERATIONS
Submerged submarine operations are 
conducted at various times in the waters contained. 
Proceed with caution.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

San Diego, CA          KEC-62       162.400 MHz

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions.
These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted
features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist
in federal channels.
