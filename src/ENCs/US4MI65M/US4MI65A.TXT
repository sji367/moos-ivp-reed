NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water 
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast 
Pilot for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Alpena, MI		KIG-83		162.550 MHz
Clio, MI		KIH-29		162.400 MHz
Sandusky, MI            WNG-582         162.450 MHz
West Branch, MI         KXI-33          162.450 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids 
to navigation. Individual radar refelctor identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOTE D

Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted 
stakes and fishing structures, some submerged, 
may exist in the area of 
this chart.  Such structures 
are not charted unless known to be permanent.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the 
Great Lakes, some features charted as visible 
at Low Water Datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should 
proceed with caution.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.


CAUTION - CHANGES in BUOYAGE
Mariners are advised that authorized aids to navigation are being changed to 
conform to maritime standards of the International Association of Lighthouse 
Authorities Maritime Buoyage System, Region B. Significant changes are; black 
port hand buoys to green; black and white vertically striped buoys to red and white 
vertically striped buoys; and lateral lights from white to red and green as appropriate.  
Changes to aids to navigation will be announced in the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency weekly Notice to Mariners and the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to 
Mariners.
