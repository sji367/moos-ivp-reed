NOTES:

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE C - VTS
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS)
system in the San Francisco Bay and surrounding areas. Vessel operating
procedures and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in
33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. 
The entire area of the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services
(VTS) system.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids.
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels
even if small craft have the right-of-way. 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with
a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist
within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried
may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating
vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exists, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found
in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
Publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to
error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - WARNING CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the
passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.
Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which
to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with
the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable
to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels
may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if
telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted
from this chart.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances are charted as furnished by the Corps of Engineers and U.S. Coast Guard.
Overhead cable clearances are referred to high water. Bridge clearances are referred 
to High Water (HW) and Low Water (LW).


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.  
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet 
in length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in 
most cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels, when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete 
text of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules".
