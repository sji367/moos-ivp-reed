 Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
