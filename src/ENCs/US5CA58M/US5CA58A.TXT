Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey U.S. Coast Guard.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Los Angeles, California.
 Refer to charted regulations section numbers.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES
Uncharted submarine pipelines may exist in the vicinity
of oil well structures, and between such structures and the
shoreline. Mariners should use caution when anchoring.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Santa Barbara, CA		KIH-34	162.400 MHz
Santa Barbara Marine, CA       	WWF-62	162.475 MHz

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required
for fixed mineral development structures,
subject to approval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast
Guard (33 CFR 67).
