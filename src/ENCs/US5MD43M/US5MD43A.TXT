AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.  


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Baltimore, Maryland.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small-craft
warnings will be displayed from sunrise to
sunset on Maryland Marine Police Cruisers
while underway in Maryland waters of the
Chesapeake Bay and tributaries.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 3 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
local Notice to Mariners.  
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - FISH TRAP AREAS AND STRUCTURES
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted duck blinds and
fishing structures, some submerged, may exist in the fish trap areas.
Such structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.
Regulations to assure clear passage to and through dredged and
natural channels, and to established landings, are prescribed by the
Corps of Engineers in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Definite limits of fish trap areas have been established in some
areas.
Where definite limits have not been prescribed, the location of
fishing structures is restricted only by the regulations.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Washington, DC	  KHB-36	162.55 MHz
(Manassas, VA)


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


OYSTER AQUACULTURE
Oyster bed aquaculture leases may exist within the limits of
this chart. Mariners are cautioned that numerous markers
may exist and watermen may be active in the area. Caution
should be exercised when navigating in or near these areas,
not to anchor or ground, in order to avoid damage to the
beds. Depths may be shallower than the soundings shown.
For more information, contact the local department of natural
resources.
