The precautionary area is RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels 
traveling within its limits. This precautionary area has been established to reduce the 
likelihood of ship strikes of endangered North Atlantic right Whales. CAUTION: Full
bottom coverage surveys have not been conducted within the precautionary area, 
so uncharted dangers may exist. See Source Diagram and Chapter 1, U.S. Coast Pilot.
