NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, 
Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S.
Coast Guard.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
New York, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES (VTS) SYSTEM
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the New York Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and 
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate vessel traffic management within the VTS area.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to 
the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), 
or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

New York, NY	KWO-35	162.550 MHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction - finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not
open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited
vertical clearance is not available for the entire
charted horizontal clearance.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
