The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system in the St Marys River. Vessel operating  procedures and designated radiotelephone frequencies are  published in 33 CFR 161, the  U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners Should Consult these sources for applicable rules and reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS participation is limited to the navigable waters of the United States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to facilitate traffic management within the VTS area.
