Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers. 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

CAUTION - TIDAL
Tidal observations made by the National Ocean Service since 
the earthquake of March 27, 1964, indicate bottom uplift or 
subsidence, in feet, at the following locations:
Chignik Bay, Alaska Pen.	            -0.2
Sand Pt, Popof Island	               0
King Cove, Alaska Pen. 		+0.3
Mariners are cautioned to expect shoaling or deepening for the 
areas listed. Tidal observations at this time are selected sites 
and the magnitude of the changes except at these sites is not 
known.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.
