The plane of reference for depth measurements in the Atlantic Ocean is Mean Lower 
Low Water (MLLW). In the sounds and rivers shown on this chart, except near the inlets, 
the periodic tide has a mean range of less than one half foot. In these areas, the plane 
of reference for depth measurements is Low Water Datum (LWD), which is determined by 
subtracting one half foot from observed Mean Sea Level (MSL).
