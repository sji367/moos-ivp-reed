NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Geological Survey.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

COLREGS
COLREGS, 80.738a (see note A)  International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.  The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, Florida.  Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.

CAUTION USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.  Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.

NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service station listed below provides continuous marine weather broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the antenna site.
St. Thomas, V.I.     	WXM-96      162.475 MHz

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms.  Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed.  Buoys may have been moved from charted positions, damaged, sunk extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.  Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.  Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations.  Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated on this chart.  See Notice to Mariners.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES  
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.

CAUTION - QUALITY OF BATHYMETRIC DATA
The areas represented by the object M_QUAL are approximate due to generalization for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning.  M_QUAL (Quality of data) represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data.  The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.  Channels maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are periodically resurveyed and the quality of data in these channels has not been assessed.
