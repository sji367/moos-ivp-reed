this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
