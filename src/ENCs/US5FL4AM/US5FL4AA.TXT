NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be
found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are
subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, FL, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.



AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


CAUTION - ENTRANCES TO INLETS
The channels are subject to continual changes.
Entrance buoys are not charted because they
are shifted frequently in position.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication "Navigation Rules."


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS

struction programs in communities throughout the United States. For informat-
ion regarding these educational courses, contact the fallowing sources:
