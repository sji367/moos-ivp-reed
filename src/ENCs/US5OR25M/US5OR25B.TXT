NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.

Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological
Survey, and the Corps of Engineers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. 
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION
The depths of water within the pool area have been determined from
conditions existing prior to the filling of the pool.  Shoaler depths 
than charted may exist particularly near the shoreline.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely
on any single aid to navigation, particularly
on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard
Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
