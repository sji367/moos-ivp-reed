NOTES:
CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90   	162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528   	162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK		WNG-531   	162.525 MHz
Ninilchik, AK		KZZ-97      	162.550 MHz
Homer, AK		WXJ-24      	162.400 MHz


CAUTION - LAND UPLIFT
The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 11 1/2 fathoms or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise caution.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are urged to use caution when navigating in the area East of 153°03', due to possible changes in depths and shoreline as a result of the earthquake of March 27, 1964.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and Geological Survey.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


TIDAL INFORMATION
