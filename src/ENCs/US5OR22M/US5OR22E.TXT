SOUNDING DATUM
Soundings and clearances of bridges and overhead cables between
John Day Dam and McNary Dam in Lake Umatilla refer to normal pool
elevation which is 265 feet above mean sea leavel.


NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological
Survey, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DEPTHS OF WATERS
The depths of water have been determined from conditions
existing prior to the filling of the pool.  Shallower depths than
charted may exist, particularly near the shoreline.
No soundings are available in areas depicted by depth curves
except in isolated cases.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.
