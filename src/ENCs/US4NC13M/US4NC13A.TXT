Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional

Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important
supplemental information.

                                
CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

                              
NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Wilmington, NC      KHB-31          162.550 MHz
New Bern, NC        KEC-84          162.400 MHz


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.

                           
CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.
    
                                        
CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Wilmington, North Carolina.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.
