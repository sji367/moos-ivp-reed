AUTHORITIES: 
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological Survey, U.S. Navy, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.
 

AIDS TO NAVIGATION: 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOTE A: 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions 
to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations 
may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, 
Hawaii or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers. 


WARNING – PRUDENT MARINER: 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS: 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


OCEAN DUMPING SITES: 
Regulations for Ocean Dumping Sites are contained in 40 CFR, Parts 220-229.  Additional 
information concerning the regulations and requirements for use of the sites may be obtained 
from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  See U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for 
addresses of EPA offices.  Dumping subsequent to the survey dates may have reduced the depths shown.


CAUTION: 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated on this chart.  
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION: 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error 
and should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS: 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS: 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations.

Kokee, HI			KBA-99		162.40 MHz
Mt Kaala, HI			KBA-99		162.55 MHz
Hawaii Kai, HI			KBA-99		162.40 MHz
Mt Haleakala, HI		KBA-99		162.40 MHz
Kulani Cone, HI			KBA-99		162.55 MHz
South Point, HI			KBA-99		162.55 MHz


SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES: 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area.  
Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that 
were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution 
when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines 
and cables may exists, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


SUBMARINE FISH AGGREGATING DEVICES: 
Submarine Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are contained within this area at depths of 
40 to 100 feet below the surface. Mariners are advised to to use caution when entering 
and transitting. 


SUBMERGED SUBMARINE OPERATING AREAS: 
Boundary limits of Submerged Submarine Operating Areas are shown by a magenta line as 
submarines may be submerged in these areas, vessels should proceed with caution.  During 
torpedo practice firing, all vessels are cautioned to keep well clear of Naval Target Vessels 
flying a large red flag at the highest masthead.
