AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Consult U.S.Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian List of Lights, 
Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


 

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report 
all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).




SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.




CAUTION - RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys
within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon.  Information may be obtained from the U.S. 
Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other privately maintained buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.




CAUTION - MARINERS

Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures, some submerged, may exist in the area 
of this chart.  Such structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.



CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE

Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge 
water within such areas adjacent to domestic water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93). 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.



CAUTION - TEMPORARY

Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated on this chart. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter 
months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard 
Light List.



CAUTION - IMPROVED

Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.



CAUTION - DUE

Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with caution.



CAUTION - Limitations

Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists 
and National Geospatial-Intelligence Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting 
stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.




BRIDGES AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES

When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.



NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS

The National Weather Service stations listed below provide continuous marine weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 
20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.


Rochester, 
N.Y.	KHA-53		162.40 MHz (Chan. WX-2)
Syracuse, N.Y.  WXL-31		162.55 MHz (Chan. WX-1)
Watertown, NY.	WXN-68	
	162.475 MHz (Chan. WX-3)

AUTHORITIES

Geological Survey, U.S Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.

WARNING

The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.

NOTE A

Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District 
in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation 
section numbers.

NOTE Z 
No-Discharge Zone, 40 CFR 140 Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, 
all vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely 
prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the waters. 
Commercial vessel sewage shall include graywater. All vessels with an installed 
marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked 
within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of 
sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations for the NDZ 
are contained in the U. S. Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning the 
regulations and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/.
