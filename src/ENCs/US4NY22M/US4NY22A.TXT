NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

 

POLLUTION REPORTS

Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).




SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in
statute miles between points of departure.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.



RACING BUOYS

Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon.  Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.




CAUTION - MARINERS

Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart.
Such structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.




CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES

Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.



CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.



CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM

Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with 
caution.




CAUTION - LIMITATIONS

Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.





BRIDGES AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES

When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS

The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.




NOTE A

Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
