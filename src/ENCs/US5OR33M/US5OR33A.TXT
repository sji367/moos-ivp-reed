NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Walla Walla, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service station listed 
below provides continuous marine weather broad-
casts.  The range of reception is variable, but for 
most stations is usually 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site.

Pendleton, OR		WXL-95		162.55 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of The Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the 
passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.  
Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size, but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 22 kph / 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to 
maneuver or stop.  A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with 
the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver.  Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small 
vessels.  Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their 
bows.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than 19.8 meters / 65 feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.	


CAUTION
The water level in the upper pool above Ice Harbor Dam may fluctuate without 
warning between 133 meters / 437 feet MSL, (pool low water elevation) and the 134 meters / 440 feet MSL, 
(normal pool) sounding datum.
Mariners are advised to use caution due to possible change in water level.


CAUTION
The depths of water have been determined from conditions existing prior to the
filling of the pool.  Shoaler depths than charted may exist within the blue 
tinted areas, particularly near the shoreline.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS 
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov

SOUNDINGS AND CLEARANCES
Soundings and vertical clearances of bridges and overhead cables are referred to the
respective normal pool levels which are 103.6 meters / 340 feet above mean sea level in the lower
pool and 134 meters / 440 feet in the upper pool above Ice Harbor Dam.


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to 
detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may 
exist in federal channels.


COLUMBIA AND SNAKE RIVERS
Mileage distances along the Columbia and Snake Rivers are in Statute Miles along the
Columbia River eastward from the mouth, and the Snake River eastward from the junction 
of the Columbia River. Tables for converting Statute Miles to International Nautical
Miles are given Coast Pilot 7.
