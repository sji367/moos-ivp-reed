NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners.  Information 
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th 
Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps 
of Engineers in Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, 
some features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may 
be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas. 
Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to 
navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard 
Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Buffalo, New York		KEB-98		162.55 MHz (Chan. WX-1)


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in
statute miles between points of departure.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water 
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).

AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information 
not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon.  Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.
