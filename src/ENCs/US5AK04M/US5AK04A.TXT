SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 8 for important
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See  
Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Mt. Robert Barron, AK	KZZ-87		162.450 MHz
Cape Fanshaw, AK        KZZ-88          162.425 MHz
Juneau, AK              WXJ-25          162.550 MHz  


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast pilot for details.
