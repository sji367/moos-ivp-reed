San Francisco Vessel Traffic Service
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system in 
San Francisco Bay and surrounding areas. Vessels operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the 
VTS Users's Manual.


TRAFFIC LANES
Traffic lanes are intended for use by vessels 1600 gross tons and over. 
The provisions of Inland Navigation Rule 9 apply to all vessels navigating in the Traffic Lanes.


DEEP WATER ROUTE
Vessels with a draft of 13.7 meters/45 feet or greater should use the "Deep Water Route" east of the
Golden Gate Bridge. Vessels intending to use the Deep Water Route should notify San
Francisco Traffic before passing Mile Rocks. Deep draft vessels will neither meet nor
overtake in the Deep Water Route. Deep draft vessels bound for anchorage 9 should
pass east of Blossom Rock, then through the C-D or D-E span of the San Francisco-
