NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed. 


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use 
with nautical charts, and the exact meaning of an aid to 
navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart 
is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway 
exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids 
marking other waterways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway southward 
From Norfolk, VA to Cross Bank in Florida Bay, aids with yellow 
triangles should be kept on the starboard side of the vessel 
and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side 
of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, 
but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intra-
coastal Waterway.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Wilmington, North Carolina.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS 
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Wilmington, NC       KHB-31       162.550 MHz


CAUTION - MILITARY OCEAN TERMINAL
Fixed security barriers have been installed at
the Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point.
The barriers are marked by numerous quick
flashing white lighted pilings and quick flashing
yellow lights.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which
the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace
as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information,
please refer to the Coast Pilot
