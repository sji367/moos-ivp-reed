AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the 
nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


COLREGS, 80.738a (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids 
has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio Station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 
40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation 
and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.  Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline 
may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys 
may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners 
should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.  Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been 
displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.  Mariners are urged to exercise extreme 
caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States 
Coast Guard unit.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.  This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
