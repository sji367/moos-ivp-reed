NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES 
When the water surface is above Low Water 
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Alpena, MI		KIG-83		162.550 MHz
Gaylord, MI		WWF-70		162.500 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information 
not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor 
navigation conditions. These surveys are not 
intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted 
features hazardous to surface navigation are not 
expected but may exist in federal channels.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with 
caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and 
Canadian authorities.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing 
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such 
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
