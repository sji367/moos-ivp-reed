NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
	

Rugged I, AK           	WNG-526 	162.425 MHz
Naked I,  AK       	WNG-530 	162.500 MHz
Point Pigot, AK       	KZZ-93    	162.450 MHz

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of certain radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging and trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based on the West Coast Offshore Vessel Traffic 
Risk Management Project, which was co-sponsored by 
the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task 
Force and U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area, it is recom-
mended that, where no other traffic management areas 
exist such as Traffic Separation Schemes, Vessel Traffic 
Services, or recommended routes, vessels 300 gross 
tons or larger transiting along the coast anywhere be-
tween Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay 
a minimum distance of 25 nautical miles offshore. It is 
also recommended that tank ships laden with persis-
tent petroleum products and transiting along the coast 
between Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily 
stay a minimum distance of 50 nautical miles offshore. 
Vessels transiting short distances between adjacent 
ports should seek routing guidance as needed from the 
local Captain of the Port or VTS authority for that area. 
This recommendation is intended to reduce the 
event of a vessel casualty.


CAUTION - NOTE B
During the calving season, Columbia Glacier Deposits ice which may drift into
the northern part of Prince William Sound.  Mariners are advised to exercise
extreme caution and to report all ice sightings to "Valdez Traffic" on Channel 13
(156.65 MHz).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices
and structures such as fish traps, pound nets,
crab traps, and duck blinds, some submerged,
may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in
the near shore area. Mariners should proceed
with caution.


CAUTION - CHANGES IN DEPTHS AND SHORELINE  
Significant changes in depths and shoreline
have occurred in the area of this ENC as a
result of the earthquake of March 27, 1964.
Tidal observations since the earthquake indicate
bottom subsidence of -1.6 meters/-5.3 feet at Whittier.
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution
when navigating in the area of this ENC 
as the magnitude of change except at this site is
not known.


COLREGS, 80.1705(see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
