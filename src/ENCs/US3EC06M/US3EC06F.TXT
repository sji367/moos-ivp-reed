Hourly directions and velocities of tidal currents at six stations are shown by arrows. The length of the arrow from the center of the circle represents the average velocity on a scale of one inch equals two knots. The figures at the arrow heads are the hours after the time of maximum flood at Pollock Rip Channel, the daily predicted times of Which are given in the National Ocean Service Atlantic Coast Current  Tables. The Velocities plotted should be increased by 20 percent When the moon is full or new and decreased by 20 percent when the moon is in first or third quarters. For effect of Wind on tidal currents see Current Tables, Atlantic Coast.
