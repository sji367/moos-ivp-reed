NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
San Francisco, California. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorce a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California. See U. S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Mt. Pise, CA      	KHB-49       162.400 MHz 
Mt. Umunhum, CA   	KEC-49       162.550 MHz 
Mt. Umunhum, CA	WWF-64      162.450 MHz 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution. 

NOTE H
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the San Francisco Bay and sur-
rounding areas.  Vessels operating procedures and designated 
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual.  Mariners 
should consult these sources for applicable rules and 
reporting requirements.  Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United 
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, 
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to 
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the 
VTS area.
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a Vessel Traffic Service 
Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System covering the 
seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay.  Vessels are 
requested to monitor VTSSF on Channel 12 at 15 and 45 
minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known 
shipping traffic in the area.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information, see the NOS tide table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as
well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
