NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 3 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered 
by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light list 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 3. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Baltimore, Maryland.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS 
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification On these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


OYSTER AQUACULTURE
Oyster bed aquaculture leases may exist within the limits of
this chart. Mariners are cautioned that numerous markers
may exist and watermen may be active in the area. Caution
should be exercised when navigating in or near these areas,
not to anchor or ground, in order to avoid damage to the
beds. Depths may be shallower than the soundings shown.
For more information, contact the local department of natural
resources.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Baltimore, MD        	KEC-83      162.400 MHz
Washington, DC          KHB-36      162.550 MHz
(Manassas, VA)
Salisbury, MD          	KEC-92      162.475 MHz
Sudlersville, MD       	WXK-97	    162.500 MHz


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small-craft
warnings will be displayed from sunrise to
sunset on Maryland Marine Police Cruisers
while underway in Maryland waters of the
Chesapeake Bay and tributaries.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
