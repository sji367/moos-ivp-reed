NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-stances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the 
nearest U.S.Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations 
are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. 
For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published inChapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard 
District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, 
Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine 
pipelines and sub-marine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  
Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids 
has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed below provides continuous marine weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 
40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Unalaska, AK	 WXK-89		162.550 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as 
well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS 
Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - EXTREMELY HEAVY TIDE RIPS 
Extremely heavy tide rips and strong currents, which at times make control of a vessel difficult, may be encountered in the 
passages between the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. See Tidal Current Tables for supplemental information.


NOTE D
Mariners are advised that low flying aircraft may be present over Hog Island Channel in the vicinity of Dutch Harbor Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has requested that vessels transit with caution and not anchor within the area.
