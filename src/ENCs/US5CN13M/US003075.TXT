Under the clean Water Act, Section 312, all
vessels operating within a No-Disharge Zone (NDZ) are 
completely probhited from discharging any sewage, treated 
or untreated, into the waters. All vessels with an installed 
marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigation, moored, 
anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD 
disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage 
(treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations 
for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot.
