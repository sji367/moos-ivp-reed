CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. 
See Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION 
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light 
structures.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.

Racing buoys within the limits of 
are not shown hereon. information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.


Meriden, CT	WXJ-42		162.40 MHz
New York, NY	KWO-35		162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY	WXM-80		162.475 MHz


SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area.   
Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.
