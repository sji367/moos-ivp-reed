POSITIONS:
This ENC cell has been positioned on WGS-84 datum through the use of rectified Ortho-photo of 2012.

COMPILATION SOURCES:
The source chart US 29742 (INT 9062), Ed.01, Feb. 2012, was compiled from the following sources: A) Track lines from Argentina, Germany, and United Kingdom, (1985-2000), scale 1:200,000; B) British Admiralty Chart 4906, (2005, from miscellaneous passage soundings), scale 1:2,000,000.

CHART ACCURACY:
Data used to construct this chart was obtained from the best available sources to dates indicated in the source listing. However, the area of this chart has not been surveyed to modern hydrographic standards. Uncharted hazards may exist. As depths are referred to Mean Sea Level (MSL), caution is advised as depths may be less than shown, particularly within navigationally critical areas such as entrance/narrow channels, inshore areas or over offshore areas. Owing to the age and quality of the source information, some detail on this chart may not be positioned accurately. Particular caution is advised when navigating in the vicinity of dangers, even when using an electronic positioning system such as GPS.

TOPONYMY:
This chart, produced under the auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization, is part of a cartographic scheme, which covers the area of application of the Antarctic Treaty. Claims to Territorial Sovereignty, addressed by Article IV of the Antarctic Treaty, are not depicted on this chart. The producer nation (U.S.) has rendered all names in accordance with its own national toponymic practice, and Regulations for International (INT) Charts; this does not necessarily reflect the practice of other nations.

ANTARCTIC BASES:
Manned bases are indicated by the name and country. Some are occupied in the summer only. These are corrected to 2002. See Sailing Directions for further information.

CAUTION:
Icebergs exist in the area of this chart. Mariners should maintain a good lookout and navigate with caution.
