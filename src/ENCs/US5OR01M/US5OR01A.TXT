NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges



WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter
2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions
to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be ob-
tained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast
Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the  
office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in Portland, Oregon.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio Stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.
