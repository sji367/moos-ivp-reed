with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error
and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with
caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor 
navigation conditions. These surveys are not 
intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted 
features hazardous to surface navigation are not 
expected but may exist in federal channels.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Escanaba, MI		KZZ-35		162.500 MHz
Green Bay, WI		KIG-65		162.550 MHz
Sister Bay, WI		WXN-69		162.425 MHz


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recom-
mended by the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian 
Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exists, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.


BRIDGES AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


TIDAL INFORMATION
