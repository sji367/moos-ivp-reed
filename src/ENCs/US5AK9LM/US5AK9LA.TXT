CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are advised that in the shallow waters of the Beaufort Sea, water levels are strongly influenced by meteorological 
conditions. Strong offshore winds can produce water depths up to 0.8 meters (2.6 feet) less than those shown.

CAUTION - DEPTHS
Depths may vary as much as 6 feet due to iceberg groundings.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed below provides continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Barrow, AK	KZZ-53		162.550 MHz

SUBSISTENCE WHALING IN THE BEAUFORT SEA
Mariners should be aware that Alaskan Natives engage in subsistence whaling in the Beaufort Sea from August 15 to October 31. 
Vessel operators are requested to contact the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission at (907) 852-2392, or aewcdir@barrow.com 
prior to entering this area for information about the location and avoidance of traditional Native hunting parties.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

RACON
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS, are activated by radars operating on the X-Band frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and, when 
activated, will emit an international morse code character which will be visible on the radar screen that activated the RACON. 
The effective range of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 miles. The RACONS will be maintained seasonally from
1 July to 15 September.
