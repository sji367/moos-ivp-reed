The U.S. Coast Guard has established an alternate route for vessels transiting inbound from the Intracoastal Waterway to the Houston 
Ship Channel. The alternate route, shown in green tint, is marked with a 300° T head range and is in naturally deep water. 
Houston Traffic requests that all vessels proceeding northbound in the alternate route conduct a securite broadcast of their intentions
prior to entering into the Houston Ship Channel. Outbound tows normally proceed south to Houston Ship Channel Buoy 26, then east to 
Point Bolivar.
