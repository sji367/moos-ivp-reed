NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited vertical clearance is not available for the entire charted horizontal clearance.

BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

CAUTION – TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.

CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water or rivers shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent to domestic water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93). Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - LAKE ERIE FISH NETTING AREAS
Various types of nets are employed in Lake Erie of which gill nets, impounding nets and trap nets may create a hazard to mariners. These are marked by buoys or stakes. This diagram shows the areas most intensively fished and the principal type of nets employed. However, fishing gear may be encountered at any location. 

SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
For complete list of symbols and abbreviations see Chart No. 1.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing sturctures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.

PLANE OF REFERENCE OF THIS CHART (Low Water Datum)  173.4 meters/569.2 feet.
Referred to mean water level at Rimouski, Quebec, International Great Lakes Datum (1985).

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys are not shown hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOTE Z – NO-DISCHARGE ZONE, 40 CFR 140
Michigan waters of Lakes Michigan, Huron, Superior, Erie and St. Clair, all waterways connected thereto, and all inland lakes are designated as a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ). Under the clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the waters. Commercial vessel sewage shall include graywater. All vessels with an installed marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations for the NDZ are contained in the U.S.Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/vessel_sewage/vsdnozone.html.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Adrian, MI    WNG-647    162.450 MHz
Cleveland,OH  KHB-59     162.550 MHz
Detroit, MI   KEC-63     162.550 MHz
Grafton, OH   WNG 698    162.500 MHz
Sandusky, OH  KHB-97     162.400 MHz
Toledo, OH    WXL-51     162.550 MHz

VTS
Vessel Traffic Service calling-in point; arrow indicates direction of vessel movement. Mandatory calling-in points are identified numerically. Voluntary calling-in points are identified alphabetically. For information see U.S. Coast Pilot 6 and the U.S. and Canadian Notices to Mariners.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.
