NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated on this chart. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - NUMEROUS OBSTRUCTIONS
Numerous obstructions found in 2009, consi-
sting mainly of submerged snags and ruined 
piles, are not charted in the Willamette River 
and Swan Island Basin. These obstructions do 
not present a hazard to surface navigation, 
but should be taken into consideration for 
ground fishing and anchoring.

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


STATUTE MILES - WILLAMETTE RIVER
Mileage distances along the Willamette River are in 
Statute Miles. Distances along the Willamette River are 
southward from the junction with the Columbia River.
Tables for converting Statute Miles to International 
Nautical Miles are given in Coast Pilot 7.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Woodland, WA	     WNG-604 	162.525 MHz
Astoria, OR	     WNG-697 	162.525 MHz	
Portland, OR	     KIG-98 	162.550 MHz


TIDES
The diurnal range of the tide at Portland (45°31'N/122°40'W) during
lowest river stages is 2.4 feet/0.7 meters.
The range becomes progressively smaller with higher stages of the river.
