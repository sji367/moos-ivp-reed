NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S.
Coast Guard. 



CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.



CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys. 


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

New York, NY		KWO-35		162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY		WXM-80		162.475 MHz


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE	
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of 
a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels 
may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in 
excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large 
vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and 
sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves 
can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft 
close to their bows.

NOTE Z
This chart falls entirely within the limits of a No-Dischage Zone (NDZ).
Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels 
operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely 
prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or 
untreated, into the waters. All vessels with an installed 
marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, 
anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD 
disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage 
(treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations 
for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. 
Additional information concerning the regulations and 
requirements may be obtained from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/
owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/. 


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if  telephone com- 
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-
ops.nos.noaa.gov.
