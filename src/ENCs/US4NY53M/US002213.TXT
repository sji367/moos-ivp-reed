The traffic lanes overprinted
are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels
traveling between the points involved. They
have been designed to aid in the prevention
of collisions at the approaches to major harbors,
but are not intended in any way to supersede 
or alter the applicable rules of the road. Separ-
ation zones are intended to separate traffic
lanes and to be free of ship traffic, and should
not be used except for crossing purposes.
When crossing traffic lanes and buffer zones,
use extreme caution.
