NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free),
or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Mt. Pise, CA		KHB-49		162.40 MHz WX2
Sacramento, CA		KEC-57		162.55 MHz WX1


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances are charted as furnished by the Corps of Engineers and U.S.
Coast Guard. Overhead cable and bridge clearances are referenced to high
water. Additionally, within the bounds of this ENC, bridge clearances 
can also reference Low Water conditions, these conditions are encoded 
in the INFORM field of the specific bridge.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels
even if small craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with
a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within
the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are
required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become
exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths
of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist,
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey,
and U.S. Coast Guard.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area  
covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which 
the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and 
subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to 
detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may 
exist in federal channels.
