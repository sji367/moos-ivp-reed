NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Seattle, WA	KHB-60	162.550 MHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


COLREGS, 80.1395 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE B
Mariners are cautioned that the Washington 
State Ferries may deviate from the published 
standard routes due to inclement weather, 
traffic conditions, navigational hazards or other 
emergency conditions.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services 
(VTS) system in the Puget Sound area. Vessel 
operating procedures and designated radiotelephone 
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast 
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. The entire area of 
the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) 
system.


ANCHORING STANDARDS OF CARE
Anchoring Standards of Care have been established for
this area through the Harbor Safety Plan. These Standards
of Care supplement existing regulations with good marine
practices for anchoring, and are separated into different
weather categories. If your vessel does not have a copy of
the Anchoring Standards of Care, you can download one
at http://pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or contact
(206) 443-3830.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


REGULATED NAVIGATION AREA
A Regulated Navigation Area has been established by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Please see Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7 or 33 CFR 165.1301 and 33 CFR
165.1303.
