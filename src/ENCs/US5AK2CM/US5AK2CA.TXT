AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U. S. 
Coast Guard.
 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. 
Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions 
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information 
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE B CAUTION
Odiak Slough is marked with two red spherical buoys numbered "2" and "4". 
The channel should be navigated only above half tide with local knowledge.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated on this chart. See
Notice to Mariners.

					
CAUTION DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone 
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations.

COLREGS
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. 
The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.
