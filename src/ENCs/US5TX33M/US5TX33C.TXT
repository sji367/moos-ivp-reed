The channel for the Intracoastal Waterway through 
Matagorda Bay is controlled to 3.0 meters/10 feet, due to the presence of 
several pipelines crossing the channel at approximate 
positions 28°27'31.2"N, 96°22'59.2"W; 28°27'30.3"N, 
96°22'59.6"W; and 28°27'11.5"N, 96°23'10.0"W. Mariners 
should be aware of the draft limitations in this channel.
