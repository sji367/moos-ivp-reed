PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary 
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information 
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, 1504 Blue Ridge 
Road, Raleigh, NC 27607,888-367-8777
USCGAUX - COMMANDER (OAX) Eighth Coast Guard District, Hale Boggs 
Federal Building, Suite 1126, 500 Poydras Street, New Orleans, LA, 70130, 
800-524-8835 or USCG Headquarters, Office of the Chief Director (G-OCX), 2100 
Second Street, SW Washington, DC 20593


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling,
particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over
which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and
subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Galveston, TX.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION
Stakes, piles and platforms, some submerged, 
may exist between charted piling and platforms 
along the maintained channels.
Piles and platforms are not shown where they 
interfere with a light symbol.


CAUTION - GAS and Oil Well Structures, 
uncharted platforms, gas and oil well struc-
tures, pipes, piles and stakes can exist within 
the limits of this chart.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than twenty meters/sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures shown, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


WEATHER RULES FOR SAFE BOATING
Before setting out:
1.  Check local weather and sea conditions.
2.  Obtain the latest weather forecast for your area from radio broadcasts.

When warnings are in effect, don't go out unless you are confident your boat 
can be navigated safely under forecast conditions of wind and sea.

While afloat:
1.  Keep a weather eye out for:
    A.  A sudden vertical cumulus cloud development
    B.  A sudden change in wind direction
    C.  A sudden noticeable increase in wind velocity
    D.  A drop in temperature
2.  Be alert to heavy static on your AM radio which may indicate approaching 
    thunderstorms
3.  Check radio weather broadcasts for latest forecasts and warnings

Thundersqalls often occur on warm, moist afternoons and are a great hazard 
to the mariner. They can have wind gusts up to 80 mph and hit almost without 
warning. To survive a squall, you must prevent being capsized or blown to 
leeward into danger.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. 
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit. 


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids 
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is
designed for use with nautical charts and the
exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not
be clear unless the appropriate chart is con-
sulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other
waterways. 
When following the Intracoastal Waterway 
westward from Carrabelle, Florida to Browns-
ville, Texas, aids with yellow triangles should
be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and aids
with yellow squares should be kept on the
port side of the vessel.  
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral 
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.



TIDAL INFORMATION
Near real time water level data, predictions
and weather data are available via the Internet
at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov. Annual
predictions of the rise and fall of the tides are
available in printed form from private sector
printers.
