The areas represented by the object M_QUAL are approximate due to generalizing
for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for near shore navigation or
voyage planning. M_QUAL (Quality of data) represents areas of uniform quality
of bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of zone of confidence in data)
attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence.
Channels maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are periodically
resurveyed and the quality of data in these channels has not been assessed.
