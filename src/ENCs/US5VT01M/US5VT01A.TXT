NOTES:

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for infor-
mation not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details,
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
New York, New York.
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers.

with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exists, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subjected to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Burlington, VT	KIG-60		162.40 MHz (Chan. Wx-2)

CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features as visible at Low Lake Level may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with
caution.

BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.
