NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.	


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at WWW.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Mobile, AL.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. 
Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO VHF-FM BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed below provide continuous (24 hours daily) marine weather broadcasts. The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the antenna site. 
CITY                    STATION	         	FREQ                   BROADCAST TIMES     
Mobile, AL	   	 KEC-61	        	 162.55 MHz             24 hours daily
Pensacola, FL        	 KEC-86 	         162.40 MHz             24 hours daily
Gulfport, MS         	 KIH-21 	         162.40 MHZ             24 hours daily

Marine Weather forecasts are available through the National Weather Service Offices in the cities listed below.
CITY			TELEPHONE NUMBER	        OFFICE HOURS
Mobile, AL          	(251) 633-6443  	        8:00AM - 5:00PM (Mon - Fri)


TIDAL INFORMATION  
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES 
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited vertical clearance is not available for the entire charted horizontal clearance.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.  Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop.  A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver.  Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels even if small craft have the right-of-way. All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed. 


CAUTION - OYSTER BEDS
Numerous oyster beds exist within the bay areas of this chart.  Mariners should exercise extreme caution when navigating in and near the areas thus labeled in order to avoid damage to the beds.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motor less craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. Sailing vessels and motorboats less than twenty meters/sixty-five feet in length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should pass port to port. When motorboats approach each other at right angles or obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when safe and practicable. Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication "Navigation Rules."


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary (USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs in communities throughout the United States. For information
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources: 
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, 1504 Blue Ridge Road, Raleigh, NC 27607, 888-367-8777

Lock, LA. Tables for converting Statute Miles to international Nautical Miles are given in U.S. Coast Pilot 5.
