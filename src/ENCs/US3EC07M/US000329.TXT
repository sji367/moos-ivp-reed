NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE G 
Recommended routing to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes of endangered 
whales are in effect within this area, but are not depicted on this chart. 
See larger scale charts.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables may exist within the 
area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables are required to be buried, 
and those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


TIDAL STREAM TIME SERIES TS_TIS
Directions and velocities of tidal currents at 3 stations are measured in hourly intervals from 
maximum flood at Georges Bank, the daily predicted times should be increased by 20 percent 
when the moon is full or new and decreased by 20 percent when the moon is in the first or third
quarters. For the effect of wind on tidal currents, see Current Tables, Atlantic Coast.
