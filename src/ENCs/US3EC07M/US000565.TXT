TIDAL STREAM TIME SERIES TS_TIS
Directions and velocities of tidal currents at 3 stations are measured in hourly intervals from 
maximum flood at Georges Bank, the daily predicted times should be increased by 20 percent 
when the moon is full or new and decreased by 20 percent when the moon is in the first or third
quarters. For the effect of wind on tidal currents, see Current Tables, Atlantic Coast.
