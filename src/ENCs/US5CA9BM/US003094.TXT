NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Sacramento, CA	  KEC-57	162.550 MHz WX1


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Only marine radiobeacons have been cali-
brated for surface use.  Limitations on the use 
of certain other radio signals as aids to marine 
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard 
Light Lists and National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION
Bridge and cable horizontal clearances not 
subject to tidal influence are referenced to 
ordinary summer low water level. During flood 
stage levels, clearances may be reduced by 
8.8 meters/29 feet or more.


SACRAMENTO RIVER DEPTHS
Although the soundings depict the general trends in depths, 
they are unreliable because of continual scouring or shoaling due to changing 
river stages.  The Areas which frequently shoal to the extent that passage of 
vessels drawing over 1.2 meters/4 feet is difficult at extreme low water stages.
The Federal project provides for a shallow-draft channel, 1.8 meters/6 feet deep at low 
water, from Sacramento to Colusa.  The Corps of Engineers conducts annual 
maintenance dredging operations to provide project depth.  Consult the District 
Engineer in Sacramento for controlling depths.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances are charted as furnished by the Corps of 
Engineers. Overhead cable clearances are referred to 
high water. Bridge clearances are referred to High Water 
(HW) and Low Water (LW).


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids 
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the 
Coast Pilot.
