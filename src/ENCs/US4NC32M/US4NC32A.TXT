NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important 
supplemental information.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Norfolk, Virginia.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


NOTE B - DANGER AREA
Area is open to unrestricted surface navigation but all vessels
are cautioned neither to anchor, dredge, trawl, lay cables,
bottom, nor conduct any other similar type of operation
because of residual dander from mines on the bottom.


NOTE D - EMERGENCY RESTRICTED AREA
For the latest information regarding the regulations of any
emergency restricted area, contact the Army Corps of Engineers,
Norfolk District, Regulatory Branch at (757)201-7653/7652.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Norfolk, VA	KHB-37		162.550 MHz
Mamie, NC	WWH-26		162.425 MHz


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SURVEY PLATFORMS
Survey platforms, signs, pipes, piles, and 
stakes, some submerged, may exist along the 
maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not 
charted where they interfere with a light symbol.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause 
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored 
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual 
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been 
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted 
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. 
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to 
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to 
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the 
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.
