NOTES:
AUTHORITIES:
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION:
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A:
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.

NOTE Z:
This chart falls entirely within the limits of a No-Discharge
Zone (DNZ). Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels 
operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely 
prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or 
untreated, into the waters. All vessels with an installed 
marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, 
anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD 
disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage 
(treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations 
for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. 
Additional information concerning the regulations and 
requirements may be obtained from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/
owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/. 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER:
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS:
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot No. 2 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION:
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION:
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS:
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES:
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area.
Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES:
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices
and structures such as fish traps, pound nets,
crab traps, and duck blinds, some submerged,
may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in 
the near shore area. Mariners should proceed 
with caution.


RACING BUOYS:
Racing buoys within the limits 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS:
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Meriden, CT	WXJ-42		162.400 MHz
New London, CT	KHB-47		162.550 MHz
Hartford, CT	WXJ-41		162.475 MHz
Riverhead, NY	WXM-80		162.475 MHz


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS:
During the boating season small-craft 
warnings will be displayed from sunrise to 
sunset on Suffolk County Police Patrol boats 
while underway on the waters around Long 
Island, New York.


CAUTION:
Mariners are warned to stay clear 
of the protective riprap surrounding 
navigational light structures.


TIDAL INFORMATION:

ops.nos.noaa.gov.
