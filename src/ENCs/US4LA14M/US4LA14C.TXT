The sounding datum of this chart is Mean 
Lower Low Water. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
navigation projects are shown with 
dashed black limiting lines. Charted depths in 
these projects are referenced to a Corps of 
Engineers datum called Mean Low Gulf (MLG). 
This datum has been calculated to be 0.2 meters/0.90 feet 
below MLLW at Calcasieu Pass and Calcasieu 
Ship Channel Reach A and 0.3 meters/1.20 feet below 
MLLW at Calcasieu Ship Channel Reaches B, 
C and D and at the Port of Lake Charles. The 
estimated uncertainty is from 0.03 meters/0.10 feet to 
0.04 meters/0.15 feet.
