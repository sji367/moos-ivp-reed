Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot
6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to
Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at
the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland,
Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to
navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above 
Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearing of sailing courses are true and distances given there-
on are in statue miles between points of departure. The true bearing between any
two points may be be determined by connecting the two points with a str-
aight line and measuring the angle of its intersection with a meridian line at or near
the middle of the course.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels shown are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with
caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines
and submarine cables may exist within the area
of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and
submarine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have be-
come exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of water
comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, drag-
ging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or un-
lighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identifiction on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Green Bay, WI		KIG-65		162.550 MHz
Sheboygan, WI		WWG-91		162.425 MHz
