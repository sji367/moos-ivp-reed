AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids 
to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone 
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice 
to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the 
area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to 
be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners 
should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable 
to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, 
dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations.

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE B
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the waters on this chart.
Proceed with caution.

NOTE D
Submerged Fish Aggregating Devices (FADS) are contained within this area at depths 
of 12.1 to 30.4 meters / 40 to 100 feet below the surface.  Mariners are advised to use caution when entering
or transiting.

additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and Geological Survey.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be 
found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List and National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency 
Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to 
error and should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
