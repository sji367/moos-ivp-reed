AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Charleston,
SC., or Savannah, GA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway.  Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop.  A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver.  Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels.  Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


CAUTION - FOUL AREAS
Mariners are warned that numerous foul areas
exist adjacent to the shoreline and floating debris
is a constant danger to navigation.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States.  For information
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:


USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, Post Office
Box 30423, Raleigh, N.C. 27612, 919-821-0281.
USCGAUX - 7th Coast Guard District, 909 Southwest 1st Ave., Miami, FL
33131-3050.  Tel. 305-350-5697 or USCG Headquarters (G-BAU), Washington,
D.C. 20593-0001.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

SAVANNAH RIVER PORT WENTWORTH TO AUGUSTA
Project dimensions are 9 feet for a width of 90 feet.
Controlling depths are published periodically in the U.S.
Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners from reports by the
Corps of Engineers.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in
length, shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the
safe passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels, when
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication
"Navigation Rules".
