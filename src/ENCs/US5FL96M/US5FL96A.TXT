AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - DRGARE AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at nauticalcharts.gov.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed below provide continuous marine weather broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the antenna site.

Sugarloaf Key, FL	WXJ-95	   162.40 MHz
Teatable Key, FL	WWG-60	   162.45 MHz

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to
marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels,
resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.

Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline
may not reflect actual conditions following these storms.

Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed.

Buoys may have been moved from charted positions, damaged, sunk extinguished 
or otherwise made inoperative.

Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. 
Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and 
are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation
to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important supplemental information.


COLREGS, 80.740 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, FL, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, FL.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

CHANNEL MARKERS
Reflectors on daybeacons and buoys along the Intracoastal Waterway are green on the left-hand and red on the right-hand side when proceeding westward.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with nautical charts and the exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waterways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway southward from Norfolk, Virginia, to Cross Bank in Florida Bay, aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY - PROJECT DEPTHS
12 feet Norfolk, Va. to Fort Pierce, Fla. 10 feet Fort Pierce, Fla. to Miami, Fla. 7 feet Miami, Fla. to Cross Bank, Florida Bay.  The authorized Federal project extension from Cross Bank (Florida Bay) to Key West has not been improved.
The controlling depths are published periodically in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY - DISTANCES
Mileage distances along the Waterway are in Statute Miles, southward from Norfolk, Virginia.
Tables for converting Statute miles to International Nautical Miles are given in U.S. Coast Pilot 4.
Courses are TRUE and must be CORRECTED for any variation and compass deviation.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


OVERHEAD POWER CABLES
Overhead power cables run parallel to U.S.Highway No. 1. All clearances are greater than those of the charted fixed bridges.


FLORIDA KEYS NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY
All Florida State waters within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are designated as a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ).  Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the waters.  All vessels with an installed marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank.  Regulations for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot.  Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/vessel_sewage/vsdnozone.html.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CORAL PROPAGATION
Uncharted submerged manmade structures, designed for the purpose of coral propagation, may exist within the limits of this chart,
principally in shallow water areas.
