NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOTE H
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the Puget Sound area.  Vessel 
operating procedures and designated radiotelephone 
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast 
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. The entire area of 
the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) 
system.
 

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Puget Sound, WA	  WWG-24	162.425 MHz

International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of the chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
