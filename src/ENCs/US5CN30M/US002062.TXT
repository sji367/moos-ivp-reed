NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 1. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed 
below provide continuous marine weather broad-
casts. The range of reception is variable, but for 
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the 
antenna site.
Meriden, CT             WXJ-42              162.40 MHz
New London, CT         	KHB-47              162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY           WXM-80              162.475 MHz


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light
structures. 


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
Supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION-TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NO-DISCHARGE ZONE
Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels 
operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely 
prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or 
untreated, into the waters. All vessels with an installed 
marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, 
anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD 
disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage 
(treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations 
for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot.
Additional information concerning the regulations and 
requirements may be obtained from the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/
owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown 
hereon. Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast 
Guard District Offices as racing and 
other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to marine navigation
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to
error and should be used with caution.
