Mariners are urged to exercise extreme care while
transiting the waters adjacent to the 18.2 meters/10 fathom curve around
Montague Island. Numerous uncharted rocks and islets are
known to exist in this area. 50% of the inshore waters sur-
rounding this island have not been surveyed since the 1964
earthquake, consequently the presence of underwater
dangers is conceivable.
