The U.S. coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Service 
(VTS) system in the area denoted. Vessel operating procedures and 
designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, 
the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners should 
consult these sources for applicable rules and reporting requirements.
Although mandatory VTS participation is limited to the navigable 
waters of the United States, certain vessels are encouraged or may 
be required, as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area 
to facilitate traffic management within the VTS area.
