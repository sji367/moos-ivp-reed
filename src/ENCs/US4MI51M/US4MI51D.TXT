NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service,
Coast Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental info-
rmation concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearing of sailing courses are true and distances given
thereon are in statute miles between points of departure. 


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits indicated are recommended by the 
Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above 
Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners. 
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast 
Pilot for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Alpena, Mi.	       KIG-83	 162.550 MHz
Newberry, MI. 	       WNG-576   162.450 MHz 
Sault St. Marie, Mi.   KIG-74    162.550 MHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some features charted 
as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore 
areas. Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart.
Such structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.
