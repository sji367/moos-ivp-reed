AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast and Geodetic Survey with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian Hydrographic
Service.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8 and 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. 
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the
District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.  Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Light List.


CAUTION - TEMPORARAY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intellegence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION-SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

RACONS
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS, are activated by radars operating on the X-Band, frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and, when activated will emit an  iternational Morse code character which will be visible on the radar screen that activated the RACON. The effective range of the RACONS will be 8 miles.

MARITIME BOUNDARY
Any international maritime boundary shown in the disputed area is without prejudice to the legal position of the United States or Canada.

WEST COAST OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC RISK MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Vessels 300 gross tons or larger transiting along the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 25 nautical miles offshore.
