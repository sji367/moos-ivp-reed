One-way traffic lanes overprinted are RECOMMENDED for use by 
all vessels traveling between the points involved. They have been designated to 
aid in the prevention of collisions in the Puget Sound waters, but are 
not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the 
Road. Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic 
and to be free of ship traffic. Separation Zones should not be used except 
for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones, use 
extreme caution.
Precautionary Areas have been established where major lanes merge 
and cross the traffic separation scheme. It is recommended that vessels proceed 
with caution in these areas. Wherever practical, vessels entering or leaving the 
system should do so at these precautionary areas. For more information regarding 
Traffic Separation Scheme procedures and regulations, see 33 CFR 167 and / or 
chapter 2 of the U.S. Coast Pilot.
