AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian list of Lights, Buoys 
and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List.

BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES. 
When the water surface is above Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead 
clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian Authorities.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest 
U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible 
(33 CFR 153).

CAUTION
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with 
caution.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  
See Notice to Mariners. 
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to 
navigation are replaced by other types or removed. For details see 
U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may 
exist within the area.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine 
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally 
buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution 
when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft 
in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, 
dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

CAUTION
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION -PORTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge 
sewage, or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent to 
domestic water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food 
and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93).  Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon.  
Information may be obtained from U.S. Coast Guard District Offices 
as racing and other private buoys are not all listed in the U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List.

NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed below provide continuous 
marine weather broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable, but 
for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the antenna site.

Detroit, Mich.	KEC-63        162.55 MHz
Sandusky, Ohio.	KHB-97        162.40 MHz
Toledo, Ohio.	WXL-51        162.55 MHz

WARNING
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to 
navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION
BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not open to a full upright or 
vertical position, unlimited vertical clearance is not available for 
the entire charted horizantal clearance.

NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures, 
some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart.  Such structures 
are not charted unless known to be permanent.
