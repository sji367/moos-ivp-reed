with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and 
Canadian authorities.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed
with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor 
navigation conditions. These surveys are not 
intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted 
features hazardous to surface navigation are not 
expected but may exist in federal channels.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U. S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations. 

Sault Ste. Marie, MI  KIG-74 162.550 MHz (Chan, WX-1)
 

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the Saint Mary's River. Vessel 
operating procedures and designated radiotelephone 
frequencies are  published in 33 CFR 161,  the  U.S. Coast 
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart. 


BRIDGES AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.
