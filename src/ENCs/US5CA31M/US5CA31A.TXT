NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
San Francisco, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOTE H
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the San Francisco Bay and sur-
rounding areas. Vessel operating procedures and designated 
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual.
All of the San Pablo Bay is within the VTS area with the 
exception of the Petaluma River Entrance Channel.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures shown, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Service station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as 
well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to 
detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may 
exist in federal channels.
