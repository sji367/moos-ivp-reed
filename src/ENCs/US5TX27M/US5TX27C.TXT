NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important
supplemental information.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Galveston, TX.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals a
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Corpus Christi, TX		KHB-41		162.550 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.



ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace
as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - GAS AND OIL WELL STRUCTURES
Uncharted Platforms, gas and oil well structures,
pipes, piles and stakes can exist within the limits.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels shown by broken lines are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - ARANSAS PASS
Strong currents may be encountered in the
vicinity of the jetties at the entrance to Aransas
Pass.


CAUTION - SURVEY PLATFORMS
Survey platforms, signs, pipes, piles, and
stakes, some submerged, may exist along the
maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not
charted where they interfere with a light symbol.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast
Guard (33 CFR 67).
