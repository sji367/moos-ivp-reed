NOTES:


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Galveston, TX		KHB-40		162.55 MHz
Lake Charles, LA	KHB-42		162.40 MHz
Beaumont, TX		WXK-28		162.475 MHz


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals
are required for fixed mineral development
structures shown on this chart, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


CAUTION LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION SURVEY
Survey platforms, signs, pipes, piles, and
stakes, some submerged, may exist along the
maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not
charted where they interfere with a light symbol.


CAUTION SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.



NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Galveston, TX.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot for details.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.

   
RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.



TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or goto http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatoary Vessel
Traffic Services (VTS) on the Sabine - Neches Waterway and
offshore approaches.  Vessel operating procedures, 
mandatory participation boundaries, and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161,
the U.S. Coast Pilot, and the VTS Port Arthur User Manual.
Mariners should consult these sources for applicable rules
and reporting requirements.  "Port Arthur Traffic" is a full
service VTS, providing a continuous Information Service;
Traffic Organization Services and Navigational Assistance
Services as required.
