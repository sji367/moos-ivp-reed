NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not 
included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RACING BUOYS
Racing Buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon.  Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 and Canadian Sailing Direction, Great Lakes, Vol. 1 for 
important supplemental information.
Information concerning Canadian Nautical Charts, Sailing Directions, Tide Table 
and other Government publications of interest to mariners may be obtained on 
request to the Dominion Hydrographer, Canadian Hydrographic Service, De-
partment of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa.
For the St. Lawrence Seaway Regulations and Circulars, special equipment, radio 
frequencies used in Traffic Control and related information, refer to THE SEAWAY 
HANDBOOK.


CAUTION - SPEED REGULATIONS
See U.S. Rules and Regulations for U.S. waters, 33 CFR Part 401 
carried in the Seaway Handbook.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. for details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Akron, OH		KDO-94		162.400 MHz
Cleveland, OH	        KHB-59		162.550 MHz
Erie, PA		KEC-58		162.400 MHz
Grafton, OH		WNG-698		162.500 MHz
Meadville, PA		KZZ-32		162.475 MHz	


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles (St M) and nautical miles (NM) between points of departure.  The true bearing between 
any two points may be determined by connecting the two points with a straight line and 
measuring the angle of its intersection with meridian line.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by 
the Lake carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with 
caution. 


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures, 
some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures are not 
charted unless known to be permanent.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids 
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light list and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
