AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation. 


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA or 
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers 
in Mobile, LA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary 
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States.  For information 
regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, 1504 Blue Ridge 
Road, Raleigh, NC 27607, 888-367-8777.
USCGAUX - COMMANDER (OAX), Eighth Coast Guard District, Hale Boggs 
Federal Building, Suite 1126, 500 Poydras Street, New Orleans, LA 70130, 
800-524-8835 or USCG Headquarters, Office of the Chief Director(G-OCX), 2100 
Second Street, SW, Washington, DC 20593.


CAUTION - GAS AND OIL WELL STRUCTURES
Uncharted platforms, gas and oil well structures, 
pipes, piles and stakes can exist within the obstruction 
areas. 


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT OPERATORS
Small craft operators are warned to beware 
of severe water turbulence caused by large 
vessels traversing narrow waterways.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way. 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - WARNING CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may appear 
to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at 
speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in 
which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure 
may block the wind with the result that sailboats and 
sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to 
maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small 
vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft 
close to their bows.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. 
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel. 
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or  
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts and the exact 
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear 
unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway 
westward form the Carrabelle, Florida to Brownsville, TX, 
aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the 
starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow 
squares should be kept on the port side of the 
vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral 
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.
