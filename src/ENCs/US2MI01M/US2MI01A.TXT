NOTES:

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Sault Ste Marie, MI	KIG-74		162.550 MHz
Marquette, MI		KIG-66		162.550 MHz
Sister Bay, WI		WXN-69		162.425 MHz
Green Bay, WI		KIG-65		162.550 MHz
Sheboygan, WI		WWG-91		162.425 MHz
Milwaukee, WI		KEC-60		162.400 MHz
Chicago, IL		KWO-39		162.550 MHz
South Bend, IN		WXJ-57		162.400 MHz
Oshtemo, MI		WWF-34		162.475 MHz
Grand Rapids, MI	KIG-63		162.550 MHz
Hesperia, MI		WWF-36		162.475 MHz

SAILING DIRECTIONS 
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in statute miles 
between points of departure.

SAILING COURSES
Sailing Courses and limits are recommended by the Lake Carriers Association 
and the Canadian Shipowners Association.

CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the
Great Lakes, some features charted as visible
at Low Water Datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should
proceed with caution.

WARNING 
Unexploded ordnance may exist in this area. Anyone
finding unexploded ordnance should notify the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard or law enforcement facility.

BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearance see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.

CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within
the areas of the larger scale charts are shown
thereon and are not repeated.

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

TIDAL INFORMATION
