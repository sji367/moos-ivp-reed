POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the

to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

Radar Reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.  


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Hesperia, MI  	WWF-36  	162.475 MHz

CAUTION -TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  
See Notice to Mariners.  
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, 
particularly at the edges.  


CAUTION - HIGH WATER CONDITIONS
Due to periodic high water conditions in the 
Great lakes, some features charted as visible 
at low water datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should 
proceed with caution. 


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at 
the office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan.  
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.  


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely soley on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above 
low water datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.
