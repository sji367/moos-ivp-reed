NOTES:

AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in
the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Florida and Savannah, Georgia.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S.
Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted
positions, damaged, sunk extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio Stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Jacksonville, FL		KHB-39		162.550 MHz
Brunswick, GA		WWH-39		162.425 MHz
Jesup, GA		WXJ-28	162.450 MHZ
