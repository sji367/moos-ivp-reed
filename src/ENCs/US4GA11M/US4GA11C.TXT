The two-way routes are RECOMMENDED for use by
all vessels traveling into or out of Brunswick and Fernandina Beach. This
routing has been established to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes of
endangered North Atlantic Right whales. Mariners are warned that some
vessels might not be able to keep to the starboard side of the routes at
all times. 
CAUTION: Full bottom coverage surveys have not been
conducted within the entire routes, so uncharted dangers may exist.
