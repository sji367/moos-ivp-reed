PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadron and U.S. Coast Guard Auxilliary, national
organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs in
communities throughout the United States. For information regarding these
educational courses contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, Post Office Box 
30423, Raleigh, North Carolina 27612, 919-821-0281.
USCGAUX - 1st Coast Guard District, 408 Atlantic Ave., Boston, MA 02110-
2209. Tel. 617-223-8310 or USCG Headquarters (G-BAU), Washington, D.C.
20593-0001.


ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The National Ocean Service acknowledges the
exceptional cooperation received from members
of the Jones Beach Power Squadron, District 3, 
United States Power Squadrons, in continually 
providing essential information for revising this 
chart. 


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel. 
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. 
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft operators are warned to beware 
of severe water turbulence caused by large 
vessels traversing narrow waterways.


CAUTION - ALL CRAFT
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.


FORECASTING HINTS
With present communications, forecast facilities and 
storm advisories, the skilled mariner does not stand 
helpless before the elements. In addition to these aids, 
marine weather lore has been passed down for many 
years. Masters of ships as well as mates who assume 
bridge watches should have a good understanding of the 
significance of wind and barometer changes. In addition 
small boat operators, not equipped with adequate 
communications, must resort to local weather indications. 
They should have an understanding of the significance of 
local wind shifts and barometric tendencies as signs of 
changing weather.
Low pressure areas are generally associated with bad 
weather and high pressure areas with fair weather. As a 
common rule, winds from easterly quadrants and falling 
barometer, foretell the coming of foul weather; and shifting 
winds to westerly quadrants foretell clearing and fair 
weather.


SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES
During the boating season small craft adviso-
ries will be displayed from sunrise to sunset on 
Suffolk County Marine Police Patrol Boats while 
underway in the coastal and navigable inland 
waters of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York.

TIDAL INFORMATION

WEATHER RULES FOR SAFE BOATING
Before setting out:
1. Check local weather and sea conditions
2. Obtain the latest weather forecast for your area from radio broadcasts.
When warnings are in effect, don't go out unless you are confident your 
boat can be navigated safely under forecast conditions of wind and sea.

While afloat:
1. Keep a weather eye out for:
   A. A sudden vertical cumulus cloud development
   B. A sudden change in wind direction
   C. A sudden noticeable increase in wind velocity
   D. A drop in temperature
2. Be alert to heavy static on your AM radio which may indicate approaching 
   thunderstorms
3. Check radio weather broadcasts for latest forecasts and warnings

Thunder squalls often occur on warm, moist afternoons and are a great 
hazard to the mariner. They can have wind gusts up to 80 mph and hit almost 
without warning. To survive a squall, you must prevent being capsized or 
blown to leeward into danger.


NOTE G
The main and Secondary routes indicated
respectively by solid and dashed magenta lines
are marked by additional beacons and buoys
maintained during the summer months by the
State and private interests.
