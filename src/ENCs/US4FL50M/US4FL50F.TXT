The two-way routes are RECOMMENDED for use by 
all vessels traveling into or out of Jacksonville and Fernandina Beach. This 
routing has been established to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes of 
endangered North Atlantic right whales. Mariners are warned that some 
vessels might not be able to keep to the starboard side of the route at 
all times. CAUTION: Full bottom coverage surveys have not been 
conducted within the entire route, so uncharted dangers may exist.
