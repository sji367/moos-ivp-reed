AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning 
aids to navigation.




POLLUTION REPORTS

Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard 
facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).




CAUTION - TEMPORARY

Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. 
See Local Notice to Mariners.




NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS

The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, 
but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.


Mt Kaala, HI		KBA-99		162.55 MHz

Hawaii Kai, HI		KBA-99		162.40 MHz

Mt Haleakala, HI	KBA-99		162.40 MHz

Kulani cone, HI		KBA-99		162.55 MHz

South Point, HI		KBA-99		162.55 MHz




CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES

Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist 
within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine 
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried 
may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating 
vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines 
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.

Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.




CAUTION - LIMIATATIONS

Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be 
found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting 
stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.




AUTHORITIES

Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with 
additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological Survey, and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner 
will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. 
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.




NOTE A

Navigation regulations are published in chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7. Additions 
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information 
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast 
Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii, or at the Office of the District Engineer, 
Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.




NOTE B
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the waters contained 
on this chart. Proceed with caution.

RADAR REFLECTORS

Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual 
radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.
