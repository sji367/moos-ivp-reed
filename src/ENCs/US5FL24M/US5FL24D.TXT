The areas represented by the object M_QUAL (Quality of Data) are approximate
due to generalizing for clarity. Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore
navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL represents areas of uniform quality of
bathymetric data. The CATZOC (Category of Zone of Confidence in Data) attribute
of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the overall zone of confidence. Channels
maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are periodically resurveyed and
the quality of data in these channels has not been assessed.
