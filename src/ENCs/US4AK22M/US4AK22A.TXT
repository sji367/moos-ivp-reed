NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
	    

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.	

Rugged I, AK   		WNG-526	 	162.425 MHz
Point Pigot, AK	        KZZ-93  	162.450 MHz	
Cape Hinchinbrook   	WNG-532	 	162.525 MHz	
Potato Point, AK	WNG-527 	162.425 MHz
Seward, AK 		KEC-81  	162.550 MHz
Whittier, AK  		KXI-29  	162.400 MHz	
East Point, AK		WNG-530 	162.500 MHz	


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along the
coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California.  See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-
ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme care while transiting the waters adjacent to the 18.2 meters/10 fathom curve around Montague and Green Islands.  Numerous uncharted rocks and islets are
known to exist in these areas.  75% of the inshore waters surrounding these islands have not
been surveyed since the 1964 earthquake, consequently the presence of underwater dangers
is conceivable.


CAUTION - NOTE B
Significant changes in depths and shoreline have occurred 
in the area of this chart as a result of the earthquake of 
March 27, 1964. Some areas have not been re-surveyed 
since that time and may reflect pre-earthquake conditions.
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when navigating
in areas indicated in the source diagram as pre-1970 
hydrography. Most of the shoreline has not 
been verified since the earthquake.
Tidal observations after the earthquake indicated bottom
uplift of 4.5 meters/14.9 feet in Patton Bay. Mariners are cautioned to
expect continued shoaling in Patton Bay. Limited hydro-
graphic revisions in Patton Bay were made from a 1983
reconnaissance survey. 


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
