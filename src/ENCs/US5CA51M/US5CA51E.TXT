NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Services, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps OF Engineers, Geological
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Imaginary
and Mapping Agency.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Only marine radiobeacons have been cali-
brated for surface use. Limitations on the use 
of radio signals as aids to marine 
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard 
Light Lists and National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Mt. Umunhum, CA	KEC-49	162.55 MHz  WX1
Mt. Umunhum, CA	WWF-64	162.45 MHz  WX5

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or 
go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

WEST COAST OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC RISK MANAGEMENT PROJECT
The U.S. Coast Guard operates an Offshore Vessel Movement Reporting System (OVMRS) covering the seaward approaches to San Francisco Bay. All commercial vessels over 300 gross tons and all tugs with tows are requested to contact Vessel Traffic Service San Francisco on VHF-FM channel 12 (156.60 MHz) when entering this area. All vessels in the area are encouraged to listen on channel 12 at fifteen ad forty-five minutes past each hour for broadcast reports of known shipping traffic in the area. Additional information on the OVMRS is published in Coast Pilot 7 and information concerning specific operating procedures is available from the VTS.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as 
well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
