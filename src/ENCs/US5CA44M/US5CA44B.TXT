snags, pumps, pipes and wrecks, some submerged, may 
exist along the edges of the waterway.

the Sacramento River. Mariners should never attempt to 
pass between the warning buoys and the shore.  
The backwaters, sloughs and cuts are not maintained by 
the Corps of Engineers and numerous uncharted shoals 
and obstructions have been reported.
