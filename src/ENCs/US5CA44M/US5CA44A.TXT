The areas represented by the object M_QUAL are approximate due to generalization for clarity.
Caution is advised, particularly for nearshore navigation or voyage planning. M_QUAL
(Quality of data) represents areas of uniform quality of bathymetric data. The CATZOC
(Category of zone of confidence in data) attribute of M_QUAL provides an assessment of the
overall zone of confidence. Channels maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are
periodically resurveyed and the quality of data in these channels has not been assessed.
