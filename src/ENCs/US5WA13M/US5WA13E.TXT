NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


LAKE WASHINGTON SHIP CANAL - SPEED LIMITS
Speed limit is 7 knots from Hiram M. Chittenden Locks
to Webster Point Light (Lake Washington), except in Lake
Union test area marked by four buoys.


LAKE WASHINGTON SHIP CANAL - BRIDGE SIGNALS
The signal to open bridges is one prolonged blast followed
by one short blast of whistle or horn for all bridges across
the Lake Washington Ship Canal.
Five short blasts of whistle or horn from any bridge in-
dicates the draw is not ready to be opened immediately.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way. 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


CAUTION - FIXED AND FLOATING OBSTRUCTIONS
Fixed and floating obstructions, some
submerged, may exist along shore of Lake
Washington. Mariners are advised to proceed
with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.

COLREGS, 80.1395 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


LOCK SIGNALS
The signal to open locks is two long blasts followed by
three short blasts of whistle or horn for vessels with tows, 
and two long blasts followed by two short blasts for all
other vessels.
Bridge and navigation regulations, including special
regulations for transit over the Salt Water Barrier in the
Hiram Chittenden Locks, are published in U.S. Coast 
Pilot 7.
Copies of the regulation may be obtained at the office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers, in Seattle.
Refer to Section number 207.750 for navigation regula-
tions and section number 117.795 for bridge regulations.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE D
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the Puget Sound area. Vessel 
operating procedures and designated radiotelephone
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. The entire area of
the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS)
system.
