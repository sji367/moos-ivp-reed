Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, 
Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers 
and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.
Los Angeles, CA		 KWO-37		162.550 MHz
San Diego, CA		 KEO-62		162.400 MHz
Santa Barbara, CA	 	KIH-34		162.400 MHz
Santa Barbara Marine, CA 	WWF-62		162.475 MHz
Santa Ana, CA		WWG-21		162.450 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are cautioned that exploratory surveys and explor-
atory drilling operations may be in progress in, or in the vicinity 
of, the Southern California Traffic Separation Scheme.  These 
operations may pose hazards to navigation.  The most recent 
Eleventh Coast Guard District Local Notice to Mariners 
should be consulted for the schedule of current operations.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE OPERATIONS
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times
in the waters contained on this chart.  Proceed with caution.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES AND MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
National Marine Sanctuaries are protected areas, administered by 
NOAA, which contain sensitive and diverse natural and cultural resources.  
These areas are particularly sensitive to environmental damage such as 
spills of oil and other hazardous materials, discharges and groundings.  
Exercise particular caution and follow applicable Sanctuary regulations when 
transiting these areas.  A full description of Sanctuary regulations may be 
found in 15 CFR 922 and in the U.S. Coast Pilot.  A full description of the federal 
regulations governing the Marine Protected Areas located within Channel 
Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries may be found in 15 CFR 922 
and 50 CFR 660.  A full description of the state regulations governing the Marine 
Protected Areas located within Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary 
boundaries may be found in Title 14 California Code of Regulations (CCR) section 632.
