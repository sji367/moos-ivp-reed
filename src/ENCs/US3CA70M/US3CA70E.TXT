One-way traffic lanes are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels travelling between 
the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to major
harbors and along heavily traveled coastal waters, but are not intended in any way to supersede or to alter the 
applicable Rules of the Road. Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to 
be free of ship traffic.  Separation zones should not be used except for crossing purposes.  When crossing 
traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution.  The normal Pilot Operating Areas are outlined by trape-
zoidal magenta bands. A Precautionary Area has been established at Los Angeles - Long Beach.  It is 
recommended that vessels proceed with caution.

The Vessel Traffic Service of Los Angeles - Long Beach, 
jointly operated by the U.S. Coast Guard and Marine 
Exchange, has been established within the approaches to San 
Pedro Bay.  The Working frequency for the VTS is channel 14 
VHF/FM (156.7 MHz) and the call sign is "San Pedro 
Traffic."  Upon entering the VTS area, within a 25 nautical mile 
radius of Pt Fermin (LAT 33°42.3’N, LONG 118°17.6’W), all 
inbound vessels shall report on channel 14 their vessel name, 
call sign, position, course and speed, destination, estimated 
time of arrival to their destination and whether or not their 
vessel will be taking on a pilot.  Outbound vessels shall report 
15 minutes prior to reaching the breakwater.  To obtain 
information on the movement of deep draft vessels inside the 
Federal Breakwater contact the Los Angeles Pilot Station on 
channel 73 (156.675 MHz) / ph 310-732-3805 or Long Beach 
Pilot Station on channel 74 (156.6 MHz) / ph 310-432-0664.
