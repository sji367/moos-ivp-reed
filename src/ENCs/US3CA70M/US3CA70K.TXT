One-way traffic lanes are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels travelling between 
the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to major 
harbors and along heavily traveled coastal waters, but are not intended in any way to supersede or to alter the 
applicable Rules of the Road. Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to 
be free of ship traffic.  Separation zones should not be used except for crossing purposes.  When crossing 
traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution.  The normal Pilot Operating Areas are outlined by trape-
zoidal magenta bands. A Precautionary Area has been established at Los Angeles - Long Beach.  It is 
recommended that vessels proceed with caution.

IMO AMENDED TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
Portions of the traffic separation scheme shown on this chart 
have been amended by the IMO. See IMO COLREG.2/Circ.64. 
Please be advised that these portions have not been revised by 
the United States Coast Guard and that the corresponding 
changes have not been updated in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (33 CFR part 167). There are differences between 
the two traffic separation schemes and caution is advised.
