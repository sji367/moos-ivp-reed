AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
and Geodetic Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog 
Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Buffalo, New York. 
Refer to charted regulations section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to 
navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard 
Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners. 
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SPEED REGULATION
See U.S. Rules and Regulations for U.S. waters, 33 CFR part 401, 
carried in the Seaway Handbook.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great
Lakes, some features charted as visible at Low Water 
Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near shore 
areas.  Mariners should proceed with caution.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subjected to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above 
Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon.  Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service station listed 
below provides continuous marine weather broad-
casts.  The range of reception is variable, but for 
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the 
antenna site.
