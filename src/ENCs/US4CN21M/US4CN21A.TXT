NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION – TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved Channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


HEIGHTS
Heights in feet above Mean High Water.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small-craft
warnings will be displayed from sunrise to
sunset on Suffolk County Police Patrol boats
underway on the waters around Long Island,
New York.
 
                 
FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices
and structures such as fish traps, pound nets,
crab traps, and duck blinds, some submerged,
may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in
the near shore area. Mariners should proceed
with caution.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light
structures.  


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS	
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


SAFETY AND SECURITY ZONE 33 CFR 165.154
Entry into or movement within this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the
Captain of the port of Long Island Sound. It included Dominion Millstone Nuclear
Power Plant Safety and Security Zone, and as waters within 91.4 meters/100 yards
radius of any anchored Coast Guard vessel. All persons and vessels shall comply with
the instructions of the Coast Guard Captain of the Port or on-scene patrol
personnel via marine band or Very High Frequency (VHF) channel 16, telephone
(203)468-4401, facsimile at (203)468-4418, or letter addressed to Captain of
the Port, Long Island Sound, 120 Woodward Avenue, New Haven, CT 06512.
 

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE Z
This chart falls entirely within the limits of a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ). Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels 
operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, into the 
waters. All vessels with an installed marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked within a NDZ 
must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank. Regulations 
for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements may be obtained 
from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) web site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
