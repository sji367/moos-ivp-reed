Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and
U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast 
Pilot for details.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given 
thereon are in statute miles between points of departure. The true bearing between any 
two points on this chart may be determined by connecting the two points with a straight 
line and measuring the angle of its intersection with a meridian line at or near the middle 
of the course.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits indicated are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with 
caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous marine weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

ARTICULATED AIDS
An articulated aid to navigation consists of a 
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal 
coupling connected to a sinker.  The structure is 
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged 
flotation chamber.  It is designed primarily to 
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 60 
feet. All articulated aids are labeled "Art".


OMISSION OF DETAIL
Owing to the small scale many aids to navigation, depths, 
contours and topographic features have been omitted.  For detail consult Coast and 
Harbor Charts.


NOTE D
Numerous fish traps and stakes have been reported in 
the area of this chart; some may be submerged. Small 
craft should use caution when operating outside the main 
channel.
