NOTES: 


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S.
Coast Guard Light List.   


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.   

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.   


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).   


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Mt. McArthur, AK	 	KZZ-95		162.525 MHz 
Sukkwan I, AK			KZZ-89		162.425 MHz 
Cape Fanshaw, AK	 	KZZ-88		162.425 MHz 
Zarembo I, AK	 		KZZ-91		162.450 MHz 
Gravina I, AK	 		KZZ-96		162.525 MHz 
Duke I, AK	 		KZZ-92		162.450 MHz 
Wrangell, AK	 		WXJ-83		162.400 MHz

COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A) 
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 8. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological
Survey, and Canadian Hydrographic Service.



WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


RACONS
Radar Transponder Beacons or RACONS are
activated by radars operating on the X-Band fre-
quencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and when activated
will emit an international morse code character
which will be visible on the radar screen that
activated the RACON. The effective range of the
RACONS will be 8 miles.


MARITIME BOUNDARY
Any international maritime boundary shown in the disputed area is without prejudice to the legal position of the United States or Canada.
