AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


LAKE LEVEL
The lake is subject to drawdowns which 
vary considerably from year to year.  The 
contemplated drawdown during seasons of 
extremely low natural flow conditions is 82 
feet below normal lake level.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See

Coast Guard maintained aids are 
seasonal from Jun. 15 to Oct. 1.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ROOSEVELT LAKE AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Aids to navigation on the lake mark hazards to
navigation at normal lake levels. Lake levels less
than 1288.6 ft may expose additional hazards to
navigation that are not marked or identified.
