Due to tidal zoning differences between Muir 
Inlet and Adams Inlet tide gauges, a possible 
error may exist in some of the charted sound-
ings in this area. The greatest portion of the 
error would probably occur in the narrow 
passages leading to the upper portion of 
Adams Inlet. The average error recorded is 
2.1 meters/7 feet. Use chart 17318.
