NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, 
U.S. Coast Guard, and Canadian authorities.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  
The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty 
extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  
For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.

SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by 
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation. 
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information 
not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing 
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this ENC. Such 
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Buffalo, New York.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).

CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers 
shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge water 
within such areas adjacent to domestic water intakes 
as are designated be the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93). 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.-

CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the 
Great Lakes, some features charted as visible 
at Low Water Datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should 
proceed with caution.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for details.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Erie, PA	 KEC-58        162.400 MHz (Chan. WX-2)
Buffalo, NY      KEB-98        162.550 MHz (Chan. WX-1)

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this ENC 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CAUTION
Mariners are advised that oil and gas drilling towers 
are temporarily established in various parts of Lake Erie. 
These towers exhibit a Quick Flashing White Light and each is 
equipped with an automatic fog signal 
sounding one blast of 2 seconds duration followed 
by 18 seconds of silence.
			
BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water 
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. 
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this ENC. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this ENC.

CAUTION - CONSULT U.S.
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 and Canadian Sailing Directions, Great Lakes, Vol. 1 
for important supplemental information.
Information concerning Canadian Nautical Charts, Sailing Directions, Tide 
Tables and other Government publications of interest to mariners may be obtained 
on request to the Dominion Hydrographer, Canadian Hydrographic Service, 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Ottawa.
For the St. Lawrence Seaway Regulations and Circulars, special equipment, radio 
frequencies used in Traffic Control and related information, refer to THE SEAWAY 
HANDBOOK.

CAUTION - GAS PIPELINES
Gas pipelines and wells contain natural gas under pressure and 
damage to these installations would create an immediate fire hazard. 
Vessels anchoring in Lake Erie should do so with caution after noting 
the underwater, and therefore concealed, positions of all oil and gas 
wells, pipelines submerged cables and other installations.

CAUTION - UPDATES
This ENC has been corrected from the Notice to Mariners (MN) 
published weekly by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and 
the Local Notice to Mariners (LNM) issued periodically by 
each U.S. Coast Guard district. ENC updates are available 
at http://www.charts.noaa.gov/ENCs/ENCsIndv.shtml
