NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-intelligence Agency Publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.

Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in

Seattle, Washington.  
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


COLREGS, 80.1395 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE B
Mariners are cautioned that the Washington
State Ferries may deviate from the published
standard routes due to inclement weather, traffic
conditions, navigational hazards or other emer-
gency conditions.  


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of  
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Seattle, WA	KHB-60	162.550 MHz


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are cautioned that a large number of logs and
deadheads are adrift in the navigable waters of Oregon
and Washington at all times, particularly after storms,
spring freshets, and unusually high tides.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in the Puget Sound area. Vessel operating 
procedures and designated radiotelephone frequencies are 
published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS 
User's Manual. The entire area falls within the Vessel 
Traffic Services (VTS) system.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at WWW.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


REGULATED NAVIGATION AREA
A Regulated Navigation Area has been established by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Please see Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7 or 33 CFR 165.1301 and 33 CFR
165.1303.
