NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey with 
additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are 
in statute miles (St M) and nautical miles (NM) between points of departure.  The true bearing 
between any two points may be determined by connecting the two points with 
a straight line and measuring the angle of its intersection with the meridian line.
 



CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by 
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low 
Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearance 
see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information con-
cerning aids to navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 
6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to 
Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at 
the Office of the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, 
Ohio, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing 
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such 
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables may exist within the 
area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables are required to be 
buried, and those that were originally buried 
may have become exposed.  Mariners should 
use extreme caution when operating vessels in 
depths of water comparable to their draft in 
areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great 
Lakes, some features charted as visible at Low Water 
Datum may be submerged, particularly in the near 
shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER  RADIO BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed 
below provide continuous marine weather broad-
casts.  The range of reception is variable, but for 
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the 
antenna site.

Green Bay, WI		KIG-65		162.550 MHz
Sister Bay, WI		WXN-69		162.425 MHz
