Log booms are not permanently 
placed. Locations of log storage 
areas vary.

A general shoaling trend of 6 to 12 feet/1.8 to 3.7 meters is 
evident due to logging operations. Extreme 
caution should be used while navigating in this 
area. Due to the profusion of logs on the seafloor, 
mariners are advised against anchoring.
