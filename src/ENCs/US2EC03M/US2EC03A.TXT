NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilots 1, 2, 3 and 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 
are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, Mass. or the 5th 
Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA or at the Offices of the 
District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, Mass., 
New York, NY., and Philadelphia.  PA., Norfolk, VA., or Wilmington
NC.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids 
to navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners. 
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is 
impossible (33 CFR 153).


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to 
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
Recommended traffic lanes have been established for the approach or approaches to 
Portland, Boston, and New York Harbors, and Narragansett, Buzzards, Delaware, and 
Chesapeake Bays.  For the approach or approaches to Portland Harbor, see Charts 13260 
and 13286; for Boston Harbor, see charts 13200 and 13267; for Narragansett and Buzzards 
Bays, see charts 12300 and 13218; for New York Harbor, see charts 12300 and 12326; for 
Delaware Bay, see charts 12200 and 12214; for Chesapeake Bay, see charts 12200 and 
12221.
Recommended traffic lanes in the Bay of Fundy and at the approach to Saint John 
Harbor have been established by the Department of Transport, Canada. see large scale 
Canadian charts.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental 
information concerning aids to navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for 
information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.
