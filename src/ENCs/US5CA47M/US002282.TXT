NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Sacramento, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.

CAUTION
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way. 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft operators are warned to beware 
of severe water turbulence caused by large 
vessels traversing narrow waterways.

CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge 
sewage, or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent to domestic 
water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
(21 CFR 1250.93). Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental 
information.

POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids 
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
Clearances of overhead cables are charted as furnished by 
the Corps of Engineers and bridge clearances are charted as
furnished by the Coast Guard. Overhead cable clearances are 
referred to high water. Bridge clearances are referred to High 
Water (HW) and Low Water (LW).

RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.  
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."
