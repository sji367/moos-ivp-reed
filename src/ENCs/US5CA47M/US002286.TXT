Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted piles, 
snags, pumps, pipes, and wrecks, some submerged may 
exist along the edges of the waterway. 
Numerous buoys and signs mark the wing dams along 
the Sacramento River. Mariners should never attempt to 
pass between the warning buoys and the shore.
The depths shown in backwaters, sloughs and cuts are 
from surveys of 1934. Channels are not maintained by the 
Corps of Engineers and numerous uncharted shoals and 
obstructions have been reported.
