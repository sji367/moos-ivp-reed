SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION -  TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon.  Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Seattle, WA		KHB-60		162.550 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


FISHING NET CONFLICT RESOLUTION
During certain seasons fishing net conflict may occur in this area, most commonly
in the vicinity of the Duwamish waterway.  It is in the best interest of all mariners to verify a
clear channel prior to entering this area. All fishermen must comply with 72 COLREGS.
For more Information please contact Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Puget Sound
at (206)217-6230/6231.


ANCHORING STANDARDS OF CARE
Anchoring Standards of Care have been established for this area through the Harbor
Safety Plan.  These Standards of Care supplement existing regulations with good
marine practices for anchoring, and are separated into different weather categories.
If your vessel does not have a copy of the Anchoring Standards of Care, you can
download one at http://pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or contact (206)443-3830.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the

13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Wash., or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Service (VTS) system in this area (Call Sign Seattle Traffic).

48°23'08"N,  124°43'37"W to  48°23'30"N,  124°44'12"W, 
Then due west to the territorial sea boundary, thence north-
Ward to its intersection with the United States/Canadian 
International Boundary line. Vessel operating procedures 
and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published 
in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/ or the VTS Users 
Manual.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
