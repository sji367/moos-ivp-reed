CAUTION
The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post 
seismic crustal rebound.  As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower 
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed 
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 
11.5 fathoms or less on this chart were adjusted accordingly to account for
this uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to 
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to excercise 
caution.

Minimal Depiction
Most features, including bathymetry, are omitted in this area.
The minimal depiction of detail in this area does not support 
safe navigation, mariners should use a more appropriate 
navigational purpose.
