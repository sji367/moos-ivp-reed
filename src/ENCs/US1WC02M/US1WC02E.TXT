AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog 
Signals for information not included in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Light List.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey with additional data from the U.S.Coast Guard, Geological 
Survey, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and Canadian authorities.


CAUTION - CHART CONTINUALLY CORRECTED
This chart has been corrected from the Notice to Mariners (NM) published 
weekly by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Local Notice to 
Mariners (LNM) issued periodically by each U.S. Coast Guard district.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE OPERATING AREAS
Submerged Submarine Operating Areas 
falling within the areas of the larger scale 
charts are shown thereon and not repeated 
on this chart.


CAUTION - TIDAL OBSERVATIONS
Tidal observations made by the National Ocean Service, 
Coast Survey since the earthquake of March 27, 1964, 
indicate bottom uplift or subsidence at the following locations:

      Uplift (feet)                Subsidence (feet)
Cordova          +6.2          Valdez                 -0.6
Wilby Island     +4.3          Whittier               -5.3
Port Chamlers    +10.5         Seward                 -3.5
Sawmill Bay      +7.0          Seldovia               -3.7
Chenega Island   +4.9          Homer                  -5.4
King Cove        +0.3          Nikiski Wharf          -1.5
Gibbon Anchorage +7.2          Anchorage              -3.7
Macleod Harbor   +31.5         Womens Bay             -5.6
Patton Bay       +14.9         Lazy Bay               -0.6   
                               Larsen Bay             -2.5
                               Uganik Bay             -3.7
                               Chignik Bay            -0.2
                               Kodiak                 -5.8
                                                               
Mariners are cautioned to expect shoaling or deepening for 
the areas listed. Tidal observations at this time are at selected 
sites and the magnitude of the changes except at these sites 
is not known.

HEIGHTS
Heights in feet above mean high water.

MAGNETIC VARIATION
Magnetic variation curves are for 2007 derived from 2005 
World Magnetic Model and accompanying secular change.  
If annual change is in same direction as variation it is additive 
and the variation is increasing. If annual change is opposite 
in direction to variation it is subtractive and the variation is 
decreasing.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted.


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California.  See U.S. Coast Pilot 7,8 or 9, Chapter 3 for details.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov 


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilots 7,
8, and 9. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to 
Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the 
Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, WA. and 
17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, AK or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, WA and Anchorage, AK.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE CABLES AND PIPELINES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines
and submarine cables may exist within the area
of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and
submarine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have be-
come exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of water
comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, drag-
ging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or un-
lighted buoys.
