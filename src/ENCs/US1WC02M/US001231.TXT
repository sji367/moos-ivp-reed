Additional uncharted submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables may exist within the area 
of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have be-
come exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of water 
comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines 
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, drag-
ging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or un-
lighted buoys.
