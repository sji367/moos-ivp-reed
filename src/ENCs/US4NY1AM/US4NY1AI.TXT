One way traffic lanes are RECOMENDED for use by all vessels traveling between the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to New York Harbor but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. Separation Zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to be free of ship traffic. Separation zones should not be used except for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution.
