NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
	
Raspberry I, AK   	KZZ-90   	162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK       	WNG-528  	162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK     	WNG-531  	162.525 MHz
Rugged I, AK      	WNG-526  	162.425 MHz
Ninilchik, AK     	KZZ-97   	162.550 MHz
Homer, AK         	WZJ-24   	162.400 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - HYDRO / TOPO CHANGES
The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-
seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of
21.0 meters/11.5 fathoms or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this
uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise 
caution.


CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT
Significant changes in depths and shoreline
have occurred in the area of this chart as a re-
sult of the earthquake of March 27, 1964. Tidal
observations since the earthquake indicate bot-
tom subsidence of -1.6 meters/-5.4 feet at Homer and
-1.1 meters/-3.7 feet at Seldovia. Mariners are urged to
use extreme caution when navigating in the
area of this chart as the magnitude of change
except at these sites is not known.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
