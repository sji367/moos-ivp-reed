NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE B
Unexploded ordnance may exist in this area.
Anyone finding unexploded ordnance should
notify the nearest U.S. Coast Guard or law en-
forcement facility.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Alpena, MI		KIG-83		162.550 MHz
Clio, MI		KIH-29		162.400 MHz
Sandusky, MI            WNG-582         162.450 MHz
West Branch, MI         KXI-33          162.450 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on 
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the
Great Lakes, some features charted as visible
at Low Water Datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should
proceed with caution.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in 
statute miles between points of departure.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing coursed and limits are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


CAUTION - CHANGES IN BUOYAGE
Mariners are advised that authorized aids to navigation are being changed to
conform to maritime standards of the International Association of Lighthouse
Authorities Maritime Buoyage System, Region B. Significant changes are: black
port hand buoys to green; black and white vertically striped buoys to red and white 
vertically striped buoys; and lateral lights from white to red and green as appropriate.
Changes to aids to navigation will be announced in the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency weekly Notice to Mariners and the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to 
Mariners.
