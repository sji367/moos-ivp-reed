Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the 
Office of the Division Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Waltham, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation, Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed 
below provide continuous marine weather broad-
casts.  The range of reception is variable, but for 
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the 
antenna site.

Kingston, N.Y.		WXL-37		162.475 MHz
Albany, N.Y.	 	WXL-34 		162.550 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables may exist within the 
area. Not all submarine pipelines 
and submarine cables are required to be 
buried, and those that were originally buried 
may have become exposed.  Mariners should 
use extreme caution when operating vessels in 
depths of water comparable to their draft in 
areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers 
shall not discharge sewage, or ballast, or bilge 
water within such areas adjacent to domestic 
water intakes as are designated by the Com-
missioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 1250.93).  
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supple-
mental information.


CAUTION - RIPRAP
Mariners are warned to stay clear 
of the protective riprap surrounding 
navigational light structures.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any 
single aid to navigation, particularly on floating 
aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. 
Coast Pilot for details.
