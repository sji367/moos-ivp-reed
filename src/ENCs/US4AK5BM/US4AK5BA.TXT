data from the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Geological 
Survey.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.  


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chap-
ter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or revisions to
Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Marin-
ers. Information concerning the regulations may
be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engi-
neers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to Charted Regulation section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK		WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Kodiak, AK		WXJ-78		162.550 MHz
Homer, AK		WXJ-24		162.400 MHz
Cape Gull, AK		WNG-529		162.500 MHz
Marmot Island, AK	WNG-716		162.500 MHz


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


LOCAL MAGNETIC DISTURBANCE
Differences of as much as 3° from the normal 
variation have been observed in the inshore
waters of this chart.


CAUTION
Tidal observations made by the National 
Ocean Service since the earthquake of 
March 27, 1964, indicate bottom subsidence 
at the following locations:

		Subsidence (feet)
	Uganik Bay	 	-3.7
	Kodiak			-5.8

Mariners are cautioned to expect shoaling or 
deepening for the areas listed.  Tidal obser-
vations at this time are at selected sites and 
the magnitude of the changes except at these
sites is not known.


TIDAL INFORMATION
