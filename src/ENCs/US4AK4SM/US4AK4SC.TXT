CABLES The symbols for submarine and overhead cables do not differentiate between cables conducting electric power, often at high voltages, and other types of utility cables.  Mariners are advised to exercise caution when passing under all overhead cables and to avoid anchoring or conducting seabed operations in the vicinity of submarine cables.  The clearance of an overhead cable may differ from its charted value due to changes in atmospheric conditions, water levels and other factors.  For additional information, consult Notice No. 16 in the Notices to Mariners, Annual Edition and the appropriate volume of CHS Sailing Directions.
