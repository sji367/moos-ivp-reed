NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, 
LA. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS 
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. 
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES 
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures shown, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio Stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

New Orleans, LA		KHB-35		162.550 MHz
Buras, LA  		WXL-41		162.475 MHz


VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES 
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel 
Traffic Services (VTS) system in the Lower Mississippi 
River. Vessel operating procedures and designated 
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners 
should consult these sources for applicable rules and 
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United 
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, 
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to 
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the 
VTS area.


ADMINISTRATION AREA 
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits
of an Administration Area. This area covers land, internal
waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime
zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to
the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more
information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


TIDES
The periodic tide in this section of the Mississippi 
River has a diurnal range of about 0.3 meters/1 foot during 
low river stages. There is no periodic tide at high 
river stages. The variation in water level depends 
principally on river discharge. High water stages 
usually occur from April to July. At New Orleans the 
extreme difference between high and low stages of 
the river is about 6.4 meters/21 feet and the mean difference 
about 4.3 meters/14 feet.


TRAFFIC LIGHTS
For details of operation of U.S. Coast Guard 
Marine Safety Office New Orleans maintained 
traffic control lights in the Mississippi River 
consult the Coast Pilot and U.S. Coast Guard 
List Lights Volume IV.
