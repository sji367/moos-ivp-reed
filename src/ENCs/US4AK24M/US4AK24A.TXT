NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and the U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task 
Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum distances from shore 
for certain commercial vessels transiting along the coast anywhere between Cook 
Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - CHANGES IN DEPTHS AND SHORELINE
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have occurred
in the area of this chart as a result of the earthquake of March
27, 1964. Tidal observations since the earthquake indicate
bottom uplift of +1.3 meters/+4.3 feet at Port Gravina. Mariners are urged
to use extreme caution when navigating in the area of this chart
as the magnitude of change except in Port Valdez and Tatitlek 
Narrows is not known. Important changes from preliminary
surveys of these two areas are charted.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Naked I, AK          WNG-530       162.500 MHz
Point Pigot, AK      KZZ-93        162.450 MHz
Potato Point, AK     WNG-527       162.425 MHz

Valdez, AK           WXJ-63        162.550 MHz
Cordova, AK          WXJ-79        162.400 MHz
Tripod Mountain, AK  WNG-715       162.450 MHz
East Point, AK       WNG-530       162.500 MHz


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.

TIDAL INFORMATION
