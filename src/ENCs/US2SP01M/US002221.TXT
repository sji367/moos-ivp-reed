AIDS TO NAVIGATION: 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  

WARNING ÅEPRUDENT MARINER: 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly 
on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS: 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone 
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION: 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.

RADAR REFLECTORS: 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.

CAUTION: Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in 
the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

HORIZONTAL DATUM: 
The horizontal reference datum for this chart is unknown, except areas with larger scale 
charts coverage. The horizontal reference datum for all areas covered by larger scale 
charts can be considered equivalent to World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84), which 
for charting purposes is also considered equivalent to North American Datum of 1983 
(NAD83). The charted features on larger scale charts were shifted by means of 
geo-referenced satellite imagery and geo-referenced aerial photography, and have 
not been comfirmed by land-based geodetic methods.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

TIDAL INFORMATION:
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.

NOTE C
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the waters contained on this chart.
