AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard 
facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables 
are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in 
depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from 
the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Mt Haleakala, HI	KBA-99          162.40MHz
Kulani Cone, HI	        KBA-99		162.55MHz
South Point, HI 	KBA-99		162.55MHz


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of 
the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many flaoting aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and 
U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
