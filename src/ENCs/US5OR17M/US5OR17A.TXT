NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations. 

Portland, OR		KIG-98		162.55  MHz
Salem, OR		WXL-96		162.475 MHz
Astoria, OR		WGN-697		162.525 MHz


STATUTE MILES - WILLAMETTE RIVER
Mileage distances along the Willamette River are in Statute Miles. Distances along the 
Willamette River are southward from the junction of the Columbia River. Tables for 
converting Statute Miles to International Nautical Miles are given in Coast Pilot 7.


CAUTION
Numerous obstructions found in 2009, consi-
sting mainly of submerged snags and ruined
piles, are not charted in the Willamette River
north of the Sellwood Fixed Bridge. These
obstructions do not present a hazard to surf-
ace navigation, but should be taken into cons-
ideration for ground fishing and anchoring.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are cautioned that a large number of logs and deadheads are adrift in 
the navigable waters of Oregon and Washington at all times, particularly after 
storms, spring freshets, and unusually high tides.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington, or
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Portland, Oregon.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of.
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


TIDES
The diurnal range of the tide at Portland 45°31'N/
122° 40'W) during lowest river stages is 2.4 feet. The range
becomes progressively smaller with higher stages of the river.


NOTE C
Rock Island Channel Buoys 1 through 15 seasonal from May 15 to October 15.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at http://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


SOUNDING DATUM
Soundings and Clearances of Bridges and Overhead Cables in the Willamette River from Portland to the locks at Oregon City referred to Columbia River Datum (Mean Lower Low Water During Lowest River Stages). Soundings above the locks are referred to Willamette River Datum which is 50 feet above Mean Sea Level. Clearances of Bridges and Overhead Cables above locks are referred to the Corps of Engineers datum for Newberg Pool which is 52 feet above Mean Sea Level.
