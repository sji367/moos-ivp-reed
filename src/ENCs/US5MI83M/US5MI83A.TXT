NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional Information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.gov


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Comm-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service,
Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. 
These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. 
Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected 
but may exist in federal channels.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted form this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
hogh elevations.

Grand Rapids, MI	KIG-63		162.550 MHz
Hesperia, MI.		WWF-36		162.475 MHz
West Olive, MI		WXN-99		162.425 MHz


TIDAL IFORMATION
For tidal information, see the NOS tide table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - DUE TO PERIODIC
Due to periodic high water conditions in the
Great Lakes, some features charted as visible
at Low Water Datum may be submerged, par-
ticularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should
proceed with caution.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above 
Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.
