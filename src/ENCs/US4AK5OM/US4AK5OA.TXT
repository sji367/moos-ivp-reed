NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT
Significant changes in depths and shoreline
may have occured in the area of this chart as a
result of the earthquake of March 27, 1964.  Tidal
observations since the earthquake indicate bottom
subsidence of -5.6 feet at Womens Bay. Mariners
are urged to use extreme caution when navigating
in the area of this chart as the magnitude of
change except at this site is not known.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published
in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological
Survey, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


WARNING – PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
