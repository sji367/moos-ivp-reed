NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Geological Survey, and U.S. 
Coast Guard.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial - Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction - finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

NOTE D
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory 
Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) system in Puget 
Sound. Vessel operating procedures and 
designated radiotelephone frequencies are 
published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, 
and/or the VTS User's Manual. The entire area 
of this chart falls within the Vessel Traffic 
Service (VTS) system.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.

COLREGS, 80.1390 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions
at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the
COLREGS Demarcation Line.
