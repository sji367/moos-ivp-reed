Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when attempting to navigate 
Whale Passage at times of maximum current. During these periods, float-
ing aids to navigation may be dragged under or off station. When large 
tides occur, the currents may reach velocities of 4.5 to 5.5 knots, creating 
boils and swirls.
