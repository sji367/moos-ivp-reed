NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to
Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained
at the Office of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District in Juneau,
Alaska or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Only marine radiobeacons have been cali-
brated for surface use. Limitations on the use 
of certain radio signals as aids to marine
navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard
Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION
Significant changes in depths and shoreline
have occurred in the area of this chart as a re-
sult of the earthquake of March 27, 1964.  Tidal
observations since the earthquake indicate
bottom subsidence of -1.77 meters / -5.8 feet at 
Kodiak and -1.13 meters / -3.7 feet at Uganik Bay.
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when
navigating in the area of this chart as the magnitude
of change except at these sites is not known.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK		WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Kodiak, AK		WXJ-78		162.550 MHz
Cape Gull, AK	        WNG-529		162.500 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
