The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services 
(VTS) system in the Lower Mississippi River. Vessel operating procedures 
and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, 
the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners should 
consult these sources for applicable rules and reporting requirements. 
Although mandatory VTS participation is limited to the navigable waters 
of the United States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required, 
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to facilitate 
advance vessel traffic management within the VTS area.
