NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - EXTREMELY
Extremely heavy tide rips and strong currents which at
times make control of a vessel difficult may be encountered
in the passages between the North Pacific Ocean and the
Bering Sea.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have occurred
in this area of the chart as a result of the earthquake of March 27,
1964.  Tidal observations since the earthquake indicate bottom up-
lift of +0.3 feet in King Cove.  Mariners are urged to use extreme
caution when navigating in the area of this chart as the magnitude
of change except at this site is not known.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
Unalaska, AK		WXK-89		162.550 MHz

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of engineers, Geological
Survey, and the U.S.Coast Guard.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification
on these aids has been omitted.
