NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids
to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and Geological 
Survey.


CAUTION - SIGNIFIGANT CHANGES
Significant changes in depths and shoreline
may have occurred in the area of this chart as a
result of the earthquake of March 27, 1964. 
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when
navigating in the area of this chart as the magnitude
of change is not known.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see Note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS demarcation line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or
revisions to chapter 2 are published in the
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the office of the District
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage,
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British 
Columbia Oil Spill Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and 
minimum distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska, and San Diego, California.  
See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


ADMINISTRATION AREA
