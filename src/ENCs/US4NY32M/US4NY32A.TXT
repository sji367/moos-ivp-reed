NOTES
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information 
concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys, and Fog Signals for informa-
tion not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and Topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, 
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, and 
Canadian authorities.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 6. Additions 
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. 
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of 
the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Buffalo, N.Y.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center 
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153). 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - MARINERS 
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing 
structures, some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such 
structures are not charted unless known to be permanent.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with 
caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by Ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for station at
high elevations

Buffalo, NY	KEB-98	162.55 MHz


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearing of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in
statute miles between points of departure.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction - finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water 
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see U.S. 
Coast Pilot 6.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.
