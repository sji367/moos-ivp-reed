NOTES
NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.  


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.  


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Sand Point, AK           WNG-714         162.550 MHZ  


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.  


CAUTION - ONLY MARINE 
Only marine radio beacons have been calibrated for surface use.  Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals as aids to 
marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and Defense Mapping Agency Publication 117. Radio 
direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.  


CAUTION - TIDAL OBSERVATION 
Tidal observations made by the National 
Ocean Service since the earthquake of March 
27, 1964, indicate no bottom uplift or sub-
sidence at Sand Pt., Popof Island. However, 
tidal observations at King Cove indicate bottom 
uplift of +0.3 feet.  Mariners are urged to use 
extreme caution when navigating in the area 
of this chart as the magnitude of change 
except at these sites is not known. 


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A) 
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

Ocean Service, Coast Survey With additional 
data from the U.S. Coast Guard, and Geological
Survey.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
