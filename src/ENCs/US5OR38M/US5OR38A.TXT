navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


ROOSEVELT LAKE AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Aids to navigation on the lake mark hazards to
navigation at normal lake levels. Lake levels less
than 1288.6 ft may expose additional hazards to
navigation that are not marked or identified.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SEASONAL AIDS
Coast Guard maintained aids are seasonal
from May 15 to Nov. 1.
