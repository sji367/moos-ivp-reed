NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Light List. 


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

NOTE E
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic 
Services (VTS) system in this area (Call Sign Seattle Traffic).  
The western boundary for VTS Puget Sound area is at 
48°23'08"N, 124°43'37"W to 48°23'30"N, 124°44'12"W, 
then due west to the territorial sea boundary, thence north-
ward to its intersection with the United States/Canadian 
International Boundary line. Vessel operating procedures 
and designated radiotelephone frequencies are published 
in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's
Manual.


NOTE F
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system 
has been established by the United States and Canada 
within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region.  
The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Tofino Traffic,
Seattle Traffic, Victoria Traffic) administers the rules 
issued by both nations, however, it will enforce only its 
own set of rules within its jurisdiction.


NOTE B
Submerged submarine operations are 
conducted at various times in the water. 
Proceed with caution.


COLREGS, 80.1385 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
