The recommended two-way route south of the traffic separation scheme 
(TSS) formalizes traffic patterns where slower vessels such as tug and 
barge traffic and fishing vessels pass starboard to starboard. Slower 
moving traffic transiting eastbound should follow the route established 
south of the TSS and north of the recommended two-way route line 
depicted on the chart. Slower moving traffic transiting westbound 
should follow the route established south of the recommended two-way 
route line.
