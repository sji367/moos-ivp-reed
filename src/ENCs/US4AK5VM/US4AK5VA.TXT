Refer to Charted regulation section numbers. 

WARNING – PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.

navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK	  	KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK	  	WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK	  	WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Kodiak, AK	  	WXJ-78		162.55 MHz
Homer, AK	  	WXJ-24		162.40 MHz
Cape Gull, AK	  	WNG-529		162.500 MHz
Marmot Island, AK	                  WNG-716	                  162.500 MHz

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIEPLINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.
