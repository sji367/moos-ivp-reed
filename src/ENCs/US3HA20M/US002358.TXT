AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated on this chart.  
See Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly 
on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service stations listed below provide continuous marine weather 
broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable, but for most stations is usually 20 
to 40 miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations
at high elevations.

Mt.Kaala	KBA-99		162.55 MHz
Hawaii Kai	KBA-99		162.40 MHz
Mt. Haleakala	KBA-99		162.40 MHz
Kulani Cone	KBA-99		162.55 MHz

Reception in some areas will be poor or even impossible due to obstruction of the FM 
radio signal by mountains.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard, National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Navy. 


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District 
in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Honolulu, Hawaii. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE B
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the waters contained on this
chart. Proceed with caution.

NOTE E 
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADS) Buoys outside 3 NM may have
a swing circle radius of up to 3.5 NM from their charted position.
Mariners are advised to use caution when transiting in the vicinity of
FAD Buoys.

CAUTION - FISH AGGREGATING DEVICES
Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are established along the coastal waters of the main
Hawai'ian Islands


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center 
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone 
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area 
of this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, 
and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. Covered wells may 
be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.
