One-way traffic lanes overprinted are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels traveling between the points involved.  They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to Boston Harbor but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. The separation zone is intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic to be free of ship traffic. The separation zones should not be used except for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zone use extreme caution. See Charts 13200(US3MAEC09) and 13267(US4MA13).
