SUPPLEMENTAL   INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 1 and 2 for
important supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 32 to 64
kilometres / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the 
antenna site, but can be as much as 161
kilometres / 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.
Boston, MA    	   	KHB-35	  	162.475 MHz
Essex Marine, MA   	WNG-574        	162.425 MHz
Hyannis, MA        	KEC-73         	162.550 MHz


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within
the areas of the larger scale charts are shown
thereon and are not repeated.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilots 1 & 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE S
Regulations for Ocean Dumping Sites are
contained in 40 CFR, Parts 220-229. Additional
information concerning the regulations and re-
quirements for use of the sites may be obtained
from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
See U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for addresses of
EPA offices. Dumping subsequent to the survey
dates may have reduced the depths shown.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.
