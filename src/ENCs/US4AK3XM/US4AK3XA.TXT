NOTES:
AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation. 


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible(33 CFR
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California.  See U.S.  Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION 
Decreases of charted depths by as much
as 3 to 6 feet were reported in 1997 in Yakutat
Bay in an area adjacent to schooner Beach from
Pt. Manby to Kame Stream as a result of the
February 28, 1979 earthquake.  Mariners are
urged to exercise extreme caution when navi-
gating in this area.


CAUTION 
Mariners are advised that in areas such as Yakutat Bay, a layer
boundary with a steep thermal/salinity gradient and/or suspended
sediments in the water column can produce erroneous bottom traces on
echo sounders, if this anomaly is suspected, a hand-held lead line should
be used to penetrate the layer for an accurate reading.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts,
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations. 

Yakutat, AK		WXK-69		162.400 MHz


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
