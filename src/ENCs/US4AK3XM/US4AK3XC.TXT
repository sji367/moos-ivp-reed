The western shore of Yakutat Bay from Point Manby to Blizhni Point is subjected
to heavy surf conditions and alongshore currents which cause migration of the
shoreline and nearshore sand bars and make beach landings hazardous. Boat
landings at stream entrances should be made only with local knowledge and at
high tide.
