NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland Ohio, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged,
particularly in the near shore areas.  Mariners should proceed with
caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S.Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon
are in statute 
miles between points of departure.  The true bearing between any two
points on 
this chart may be determined by connecting the two points with a straight line
and measuring the angle of its intersection with a meridian line at or near the 
middle of
the course.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed.  For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Alpena, MI			KIG-83		162.550 MHz
Clio, MI			KIH-29		162.400 MHz
Sault Ste Marie, MI	        KIG-74		162.550 MHz
Gaylord, MI			WWF-70		162.500 MHz


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above
Low Water Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. 
For clearances see U.S. Coast Pilot 6.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible.(33 CFR 153)


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey,
U.S. Coast Guard and Canadian authorities.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental information.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon.  Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation.  See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


TIDAL INFORMATION
