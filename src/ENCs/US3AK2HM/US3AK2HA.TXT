NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may 
have occurred in the area of this chart as a result of 
the earthquake of March 27, 1964. Tidal obser-
vations since the earthquake indicate bottom uplift 
of +1.3 meters/4.3 feet at Point Gravina. Mariners are urged to 
use extreme caution when navigating in the area 
of this chart as the magnitude of change except in 
Port Valdez and Tatitlek Narrows is not known. 
Important changes from preliminary surveys of 
these two areas are charted.
 

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Rugged I, AK		WNG-526 	162.425 MHz
Point Pigot, AK      	KZZ-93  	162.450 MHz
Cape Hinchinbrook 	WNG-532 	162.525 MHz
Potato Point, AK    	WNG-527 	162.425 MHz
Wasilla, AK    		KZZ-98  	162.400 MHz 
Cordova, AK 		WXJ-79 		162.400 MHz
Valdez, AK 		WXJ-63 		162.550 MHz
Whittier, AK    	KXI-29  	162.400 MHz
East Point, AK 		WNG-530		162.500 MHz
Tripod Mountain, AK 	WNG-715 	162.450 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOTE C
During the calving season, Columbia Glacier deposits 
ice which may drift into the northen part of Prince 
William Sound. Mariners are advised to exercise extreme 
caution and to report all ice sightings to 'Valdez Traffic' on 
Channel 13 (156.65 MHz)


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along the 
coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska, and San Diego, California.  
See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, 
particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
