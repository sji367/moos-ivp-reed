Mariners are urged to exercise extreme care
while transiting the waters adjacent to the 18.2 meter/10 
fathom curve around Montague and Green 
Islands. Numerous uncharted rocks and 
islets are known to exist in these areas, 75% 
of the inshore waters surrounding these 
islands have not been surveyed since the 
1964 earthquake, consequently the presence 
of underwater dangers is conceivable.
