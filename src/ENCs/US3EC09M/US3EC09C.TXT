RECOMMENDED TWO-WAY WHALE AVOIDANCE ROUTES and TRACK
The two-way routes and two-way track are RECOMMENDED
for use by all vessels traveling into or out of Cape Cod Bay. This routing has been 
established to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes of endangered North Atlantic right 
whales. Mariners are warned that some vessels might not be able to keep to the
starboard side of the route or track at all times. CAUTION: Full bottom coverage
surveys have not been conducted within the entire route, so uncharted dangers
may exist. See Source Diagram and Chapter 1, U.S. Coast Pilot.
