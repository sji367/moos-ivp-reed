RECOMMENDED TWO-WAY WHALE AVOIDANCE ROUTES and TRACK
The two-way routes and two-way track shown on this cell are RECOMMENDED for 
use by all vessels traveling into or out of Cape Cod Bay. This routing has been 
established to reduce the likelihood of ship strikes of endangered North Atlantic right 
whales. Mariners are warned that some vessels might not be able to keep to the starboard 
side of the route or track at all times. CAUTION: Full bottom coverage surveys have not 
been conducted within the entire route, so uncharted dangers may exist. See Source Diagram 
and Chapter 1, U.S. Coast Pilot.
