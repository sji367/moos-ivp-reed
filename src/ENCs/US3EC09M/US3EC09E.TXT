NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and
Canadian Charts.
 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilots 1 & 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are 
published in the Notice to Mariners. Information con-
cerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of 
the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA 
or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Eng-
ineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CURRENT DIAGRAM GEORGES BANK AND NANTUCKET SHOALS
Hourly directions and velocities of tidal currents at thirteen stations are shown by
arrows. The length of the arrow from the center of the circle represents the average
velocity on a scale of one inch equals two knots. The figures at the arrow heads are the
hours after the time of maximum flood at Pollock Rip Channel, the daily predicted times 
of which are given in the National Ocean Service Atlantic Coast Current Tables. The 
velocities plotted should be increased by 20 percent when the moon is full or new and 
decreased by 20 percent when the moon is in first or third quarters. For effect of wind 
on tidal currents, see Current Tables, Atlantic Coast.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
