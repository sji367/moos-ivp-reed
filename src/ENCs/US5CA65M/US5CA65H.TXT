TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
One-way traffic lanes are RECOMMENDED for 
use by all vessels traveling between the points involved.  They have been 
designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to the 
major harbors and along heavily traveled coastal waters, but are not 
intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road.  
Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic 
and to be free of ship traffic.  Separation zones should notbe used except 
for crossing purposes.  When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use 
extreme caution. 

IMO AMENDED TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
Portions of the traffic separation scheme 
have been amended by the IMO. See IMO COLREG.2/Circ.64.  
Please be advised that these portions have not been revised by 
the United States Coast Guard and that the corresponding 
changes have not been updated in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (33 CFR part 167). There are differences between 
the two traffic separation schemes and caution is advised.
