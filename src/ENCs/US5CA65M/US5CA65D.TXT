Mariners are cautioned that severe wave action 
may be encountered over the shoals either side of 
the marked entrance channel. Inbound and out-
bound boaters are advised by local interests to run 
a direct course from Ventura Marina Entrance Lighted 
Whistle Buoy "2V" to the breakwater entrance.
