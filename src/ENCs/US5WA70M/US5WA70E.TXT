Acoustic sensors, consisting of a concrete anchor and
tethered instrument package floating above the anchor,
are positioned approximately 1000 yards apart along the
line. The depth of the floating portion of the instrument
varies with local bottom depth. For instruments anchored
at less than 150m depth (near shore), the floating portion
of the instrument is within 5m of the bottom. For instruments
anchored at 150m depth or greater, the instrument package
is tethered approximately 150m below the water surface.
