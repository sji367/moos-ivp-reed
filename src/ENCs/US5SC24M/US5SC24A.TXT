data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4.Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, FL, or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Charleston, SC.
Refer to charted Regulation section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


FISHING AND HUNTING STRUCTURES
Uncharted fish and wildlife harvesting devices
and structures such as fish traps, pound nets,
crab traps, and duck blinds, some submerged,
may exist in the area of this chart, particularly in
the near shore area. Mariners should proceed
with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-intelligence Agency 	Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS 
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Charleston, SC		KHB-29		       162.550 MHz
Savannah, GA		KEC-85		       162.400 MHz
Beaufort, SC		WXJ-23		       162.450 MHz
Metter, GA		WWH-25	               162.425 MHz


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS 
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or
moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
