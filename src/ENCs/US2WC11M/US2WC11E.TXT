NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


POLLUTION REPORTS  
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.
See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
Center List of Lights and Fog Signals for informa-
tion not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Comman-
der, 11th Coast Guard District in Long Beach, California, or
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.
 
 
CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES  
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.
Oil well structures and submarine pipelines
and cables are charted only where outside of
the indicated limits of charts 18720 and 18740.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES  
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral 
development structures shown, subject to approval by the District 
Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


VESSELS TRANSITING 
The U.S. Coast Guard and Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.


NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES & MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
National Marine Sanctuaries are protected areas, administered by NOAA, which 
contain sensitive and diverse natural and cultural resources. These areas are particularly 
sensitive to environmental damage such as spills of oil and other hazardous materials, 
discharges and groundings. Exercise particular caution and follow applicable Sanctuary 
regulations when transiting these areas. A full description of Sanctuary regulations 
may be found in 15 CFR 922 and in the U.S. Coast Pilot. A full description of the 
federal regulations governing the Marine Protected Areas located within Channel 
Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries may be found in 15 CFR 922 and 50 
CFR 660. A full description of the state regulations governing the Marine Protected 
Areas located within Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary boundaries may be 
found in Title 14 California Code of Regulations (CCR) section 632.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
