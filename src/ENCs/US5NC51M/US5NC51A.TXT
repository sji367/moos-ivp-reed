NOTES:
RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed. 


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 5th Coast Guard District in 
Portsmouth, VA, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Wilmington, NC.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - DANGER
Unexploded projectiles exist in the waterways 
east of the Intracoastal Waterway from Bear Inlet 
to Onslow Beach Bridge. 


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact 
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear 
unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway 
southward from Norfolk, VA to Cross Bank in 
Florida Bay, aids with yellow triangles should 
be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and 
aids with yellow squares should be kept on the 
port side of the vessel. 
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral 
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. 
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules".


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary 
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating in-
struction programs in communities throughout the United States. For more 
information regarding these educational courses, contact the following sources:

USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, P.O. Box 30423, 
Raleigh, NC 27612, Tel. 919-821-0281.
USCGAUX - 5th Coast Guard District, Federal Building, 431 Crawford St., 
Portsmouth, VA 23704-5004, Tel. 804-398-6208 or USCG Headquarters (G-BAU). 
Washington, DC 20593-0001.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause 
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored 
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual 
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been 
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted 
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. 
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to 
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to 
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the 
nearest United States Coast Guard Unit.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
