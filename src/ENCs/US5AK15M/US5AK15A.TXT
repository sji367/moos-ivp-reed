NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological	
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important
supplemental information.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION – TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
The buoys in Cook Inlet are seasonally
maintained from May 1 to Nov. 1. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS	
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.	
            
Rugged I, AK     WNG-526    162.425 MHz	
Point Pigot, AK  KZZ-93     162.450 MHz
Bede Mt, AK      WNG-528    162.450 MHz
Ninilchik, AK    KZZ-97     162.550 MHz
Wasilla, AK      KZZ-98     162.400 MHz

Soldotna, AK     WWG-39     162.475 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast
Pilot for details.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.Additions
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer,
Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral
development structures shown, subject to approval by the District
Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


CAUTION
Oil exploration and production operations
are being conducted in the waters of cook inlet.
Drilling vessels and movable and permanent
platforms are being used. Only permanent
platforms are charted. Mariners are urged to
exercise caution when transiting the area.


CAUTION
The Cook inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-
seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of
21 meters/11.5 fathoms or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this
uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise
caution.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
