NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville,
Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important
supplemental information.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
Tampa, FL		KHB-32		162.550 MHz
Sarasota, FL		WWG-59	162.400 MHz
Largo Marine, FL	KEC-38		162.450 MHz


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous subs-
tances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals
are required for fixed mineral development
structures shown, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast
Guard (33 CFR 67).


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within
the areas of the larger scale charts are shown
thereon and are not repeated on this chart.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions.
These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted
features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist
in federal channels.
