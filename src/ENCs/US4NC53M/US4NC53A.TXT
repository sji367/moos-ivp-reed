Intelligence Agency.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chap-
ter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to 
Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Marin-
ers. Information concerning the regulations may 
be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 5th 
Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Virginia, or at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engi-
neers in Norfolk Wilmington, North Carolina.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an 
Administration Area.  This area covers land, internal waters, and 
territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United 
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well to its 
bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the approximate charts is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway
Southward from Norfolk, VA to Cross Bank in
Florida Bay, aids with yellow triangles should
be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and
aids with yellow squares should be kept on the
port side of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - DUCK BLINDS
Numerous duck blinds, stakes, piles, pipes, 
and floating fish nets exist in the water area of 
this chart.
Mariners are warned that numerous areas 
adjacent to the shoreline are foul with trees. 
Snags are not charted because they frequently 
change in position.


CAUTION - RIPRAP
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light 
structures.


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stem waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel.  
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. 
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port. 
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases. 
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable. 
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadron (USPS) and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary 
(USCGAUX), national organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating 
instruction programs in communities throughout the United States. For 
information regarding these educational courses, contact the following 
sources: 
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS Headquarters, Post Office 
Box 30423, Raleigh, N.C. 27612, 919-821-0281.
USCGAUX - 5th Coast Guard District, Federal Building, 431 Crawford St, 
Portsmouth, VA 23704-5004, 804-393-6486 or USCG Headquarters 
(G-BAU), Washington D.C. 20593-0001.


CAUTION - Small Craft
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way. 
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.

CAUTION - HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations. 
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. 
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved. 
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
