NOTES:
CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS

Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - USACE SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. 
These surveys are not intended to detect underwater features. Uncharted 
features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may exist 
in federal channels.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when en-
dangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.






SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures, 
some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures are not 
charted unless known to be permanent.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).



RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.



Adrian, MI	WNG-647		162.450 MHz

Detroit, MI	KEC-63		162.550 MHz



Sandusky, OH    KHB-97		162.400 MHz
Toledo, OH      WXL-51		162.550 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental infor-
mation concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List Of Lights, Buoys and Fog 
Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.





BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES

When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly. For clearances see
U.S. Coast Pilot 6.





CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes, some 
features charted as visible at Low Water Datum may be submerged, 
particularly in the near shore areas. Mariners should proceed with 
caution.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio, or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S.Coast Pilot for details.
