NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, With additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and  U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations. 
 
Coos Bay, OR          KIH-32   162.400 MHz
Eugene, OR            KEC-42   162.400 MHz
Newport, OR           KIH-33   162.550 MHz
Florence, OR          WNG-674  162.500 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Rader reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - VESSEL TRANSITING 
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary 
measures and minimum
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along
the coast anywhere 
between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego,
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.
