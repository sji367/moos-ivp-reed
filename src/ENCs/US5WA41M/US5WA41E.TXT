NOTES:
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and
Fog Signals for information not included in
the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via

is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.

CANADIAN WEATHER RADIO BROADCAST
The Canadian Weather Service station listed
below provides continuous marine weather 
broadcasts. The range of reception is variable, but
for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from
the antenna site.

COLREGS, 80.1390 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
