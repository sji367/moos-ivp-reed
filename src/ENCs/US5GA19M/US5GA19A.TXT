AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at  the Office of the Commander, 
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office 
of the District  Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, 
Florida.
Refer to Charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subiect to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - WARNING CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver.  Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. see 
Local Notice to Mariners.	


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length, shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
channel. 
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port.
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way  in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels, when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete  text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S.  Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules".


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
The United States Power Squadrons and U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, national 
organizations of boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs in 
communities throughout the United States. For information regarding these free 
educational courses, contact the following sources:
USPS - Local Squadron Commander or USPS National Headquarters, Post 
Office Box 30423, Raleign, North Carolina 27612, 919-821-0281.

3050, Tel. 305-5397 or USCG Headquarters (G-BAU), Washington, D.C, 
20593-0001.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may 
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to 
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris 
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not 
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to 
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may 
have been moved from their positions, damaged, sunk, 
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should 
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered 
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are 
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and 
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard 
unit.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIEPLINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


INTRA COASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use 
with nautical charts and the exact meaning of an aid to 
navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart 
is consulted. 
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway 
exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids 
marking other waterways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway southward 
from Norfolk, VA to Cross Bank in Florida Bay, aids with yellow 
triangles should be kept on the starboard side of the vessel 
and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side 
of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, 
but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intra-
coastal Waterway.
