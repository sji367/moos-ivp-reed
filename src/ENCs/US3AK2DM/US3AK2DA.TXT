NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Survey, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - AN AREA
An area within the limits of this chart is affected by land uplift due to forces 
such as postseismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including 
mean lower low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have 
changed in this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 21 meters/11 1/2 
fathoms or less on this chart were adjusted accordingly, to account for this uplift, 
north of latitude 59°12', and west of longitude 149°00'. As the uplift rates 
can only be estimated and areas continue to rise, depths may be shoaler 
than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise caution.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorce a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
