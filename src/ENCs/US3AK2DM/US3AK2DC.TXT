Based on the West Coast Offshore Vessel Traffic Risk Management project,
which was co-sponsored by the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task
Force and U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area, it is recommended that, where no
other traffic management areas exist such as Traffic Separation Schemes,
Vessel Traffic Services, or recommended routes, vessels 300 gross tons or
larger transiting along the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet and San Diego
should voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 25 nautical miles offshore. It
is also recommended that tank ships laden with persistent petroleum products
and transiting along the coast between Cook Inlet and San Diego should 
voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 50 nautical miles offshore. Vessels 
transiting short distances between adjacent ports should seek routing
guidance as needed from the local Captain of the Port or VTS authority for 
that area. This recommendation is intended to reduce the potential for 
vessel groundings and resulting oil spills in the event of a vessel casualty.
