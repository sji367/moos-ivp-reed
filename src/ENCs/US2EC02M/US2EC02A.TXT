NOTES:

AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.

SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
For Symbols and Abbreviations, see Chart No. 1.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION – USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, Va., and 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Fl., or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Wilmington, N.C.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; and Jacksonville, Fl. Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - NOTE E
Numerous fish havens marked by private buoys exist seaward of the 10-fathom curve from St Marys Entrance to Ponce de Leon Inlet and are not shown. See larger scale charts for locations.

CAUTION - NOTE G
Trawlers or other vessels should exercise caution while dragging the ocean floor within a 40 mile radius of Cape Canaveral.  Missile debris, some of which may contain unexploded ordinance, exists in this area.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.

COLREGS DEMARCATION LINES
Colregs demarcation lines follow the general trend of the seaward, high-water shoreline except where charted.
