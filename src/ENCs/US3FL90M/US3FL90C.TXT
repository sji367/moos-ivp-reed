No-Discharge Zone 40 CFR 140
All Florida State waters within the Florida Keys National
Marine Sanctuary are designated as a No-Discharge Zone
(NDZ).  Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all
vessels operating within a No-Discharging Zone (NDZ) are
completely prohibited from discharging any sewage,
treated or untreated, into the waters.  All vessels with an
installed marine sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating,
moored, anchored, or docked within a NDZ must have
the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard discharge of
sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding tank.
Regulations for the NDZ are contained in the U.S.
Coast Pilot.  Additional information concerning the
regulations and requirements may be obtained from the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) web site:
