AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. 
See National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center 
List of Lights and Fog Signals for 
information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7. 
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. 
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at 
the Office of the Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California, or 
at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Los Angeles, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers. 

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids. 
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

WEST COAST OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC RISK MANAGEMENT PROJECT
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force 
endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum distances from shore for 
certain commercial vessels transiting along the coast 
anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, California.
See U.S. Coast Pilot 7, Chapter 3 for details.
Vessels 300 gross tons or larger transiting along the coast 
anywhere between Cook Inlet and San Diego 
should voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 25 nautical miles offshore.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center 
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. 
See Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation 
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations 
are subject to error and should be used with caution.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. 
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, 
but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Los Angeles, CA	 KWO-37     162.550 MHz
San Diego, CA	 KEC-62     162.400 MHz
Santa Ana, CA	 WWG-21     162.450 MHz

RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart are not shown hereon. 
Information may be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District Offices 
as racing and other private buoys 
are not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.

CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within the areas of the larger scale charts
are shown thereon and are not repeated on this chart.
