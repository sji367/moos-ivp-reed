The hydrography on this preliminary chart is of varying degrees of quality. In the areas of 
sparse soundings many of the depths were taken by lead line in the early 1900’s, so further 
uncharted shoals are likely. The depths in the area of dense soundings were acquired by 
modern survey methods.
Navigators should use this chart with extreme caution and report discrepancies or hazards to 
the Chief, Marine Chart Division (N/CS2), National Ocean Service, NOAA, Silver Spring, 
Maryland 20910-3282.
