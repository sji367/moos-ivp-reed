The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


AUTHORITIES

Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S.
Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to
navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


REGULATED NAVIGATION AREA
A Regulated Navigation Area has been established by the U.S. Coast Guard.
Please see Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7 or 33 CFR 165.1301 and 33 CFR
165.1303.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the Puget Sound area. Vessel
operating procedures and designated radiotelephone
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast
Pilot and/or the VTS User's Manual. The entire area of
the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system.

sea is a maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty
extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information,
