CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have occurred in the 
area of chart as a result of the earthquake of March 27, 1964. Tidal 
observations since the earthquake indicate bottom uplift of +0.3 feet at 
King Cove, Alaska Peninsula and bottom subsidence of -0.2 feet of 
Chignick Bay, Alaska Peninsula. Observations at Sand Point, Popof 
Island, Indicated there was no change at that location. Mariners are 
urged to use extreme caution when navigating in the area of this chart 
as the magnitude of change except at these sites is not known.

The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
