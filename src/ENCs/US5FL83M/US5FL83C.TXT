Strong tidal currents exist perpendicular to the Bridge of Lions opening. Vessels engaged in towing and pushing operation are advised to transit the bridge opening during slack tide and, if necessary, breakdown the tow in small units or use adequate tugs.

For bascule bridges, whose spans do not open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited vertical clearance is not available for the entire horizontal clearance.
