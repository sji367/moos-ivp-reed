International Regulations for Preventing Collisions of Sea, 1972.  The entire area falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

RACON: 
Radar Transponder Beacons, or RACONS, are activated by radars operating on the X-band, frequencies 9300 to 9450 MHz and, when activated will emit an international morse code character which will be visible on the radar screen that activated the RACON.  The effective range of the RACONS will be from 11 to 27 miles.  The RACONS will be maintained seasonally from 1 July to 15 September.
