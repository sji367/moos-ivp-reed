NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 2. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard 
District in Boston, MA or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Concord, MA.

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone 
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the protective riprap surrounding navigational 
light structures.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations.

New London, CT    	KHB-47       	162.55 MHz
Meriden, CT           	WXJ-42       	162.40 MHz
Hartford, CT          	WXJ-41       	162.475 MHz
Riverhead, NY     	WXM-80 		162.475 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
Small craft warnings will be displayed from sunrise to 
sunset from Suffolk County Marine Police Patrol Boats 
underway in the coastal and navigable inland waters of 
Suffolk County, Long Island, New York: For boating 
season only.


CABLE AND PIPELINE AREAS
The cable and pipeline areas falling within 
the areas of the larger scale charts are shown 
thereon and are not repeated.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be 
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District 
Offices as racing and other private buoys are 
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted.
