NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

 
CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines
and submarine cables may exist within the
area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines
and submarine cables are required to be
buried, and those that were originally buried
may have become exposed. Mariners should
use extreme caution when operating vessels in
depths of water comparable to their draft in
areas where pipelines and cables may exist,
and when anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are
published in the Notices to Mariners. Information con-
cerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida,
or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers
in Jacksonville, Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Miami, FL		KHB-34	162.550 MHz
West Palm Beach, FL	KEC-50	162.475 MHz
Princeton, FL		WNG-663 162.425 MHz


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important supplemental information.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S.
Coast Guard.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to
navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may
cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to
navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris
in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not
reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to
navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may
have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk,
extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should
not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation.
Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered
or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are
requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and
hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard
unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identifiction on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS tide table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


CORAL PROPAGATION
Uncharted submerged manmade structures, designed for the purpose of coral propagation, may exist within the limits of this chart,
principally in shallow water areas.
