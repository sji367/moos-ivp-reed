NOTES:
AUTHORITIES: 
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION: 
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A: 
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 5.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, 
LA.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER: 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS: 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION: 
Fixed and floating obstructions, some 
submerged, may exist within the magenta tinted
bridge construction area.  Mariners are advised to 
proceed with caution.


CAUTION: 
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION: 
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION: 
Numerous bridges and overhead cables cross the waterways
of this area.  Some are not shown because of
the small scale.
See larger scale charts and U.S. Coast Pilot 5.

CAUTION: 
Platforms, gas and oil well structures, some of which are submerged 
and capped, and submarine pipelines and cables are not shown.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms.  Fixed aids to navigation may have been
damaged or destroyed.  Buoys may have been moved from their charted
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to
navigation.  Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations.  Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the
nearest United States Coast Guard unit. 

ARTICULATED AIDS: 
An articulated aid to navigation consists of a
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal
coupling connected to a sinker.  The structure is
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged
flotation chamber.  It is designed primarily to
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 18.3 meters/60
feet.

RADAR REFLECTORS: 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.

	    
RULES OF THE ROAD: 
See U.S. Coast Guard Publication 'Navigation
Rules' for Rules of the Road.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS: 
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts, and the exact
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear
unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway 
westward from Carrabelle, FL to Brownsville, TX,
aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the
starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow
squares should be kept on the port side of the
vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral 
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.
