The hydrography on this preliminary chart is of varying degrees of
quality. In the areas of sparse soundings many of the depths were taken
by lead line in the early 1900's, so further uncharted shoals are likely. The
depths in the area of dense soundings were acquired by modern survey
methods. Navigators should use this chart with extreme caution and report
discrepancies to the Director, Marine Chart Division (N/CS2), National Ocean
Service, NOAA, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.
This preliminary chart is distributed as an interim product while modern
surveys are being conducted.
