POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response

COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.  
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast 
Pilot 9.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published 
in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
17th Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have occurred 
in the area of this chart as a result of the earthquake of March 
27, 1964. Tidal observations since the earthquake indicate 
bottom subsidence of 0.06 meter/-0.2 feet at Chignik Bay, Alaska 
Peninsula. Observations at Sand Point, Popof Island, 
indicated there was no change at that location.  Mariners 
are urged to use extreme caution when navigating in the 
area of this chart as the magnitude of change except at 
these sites is not known.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological
Survey, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER 
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
