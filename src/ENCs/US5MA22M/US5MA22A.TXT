NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
New York, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Meriden, CT             WXJ-42        162.40 MHz
New London, CT          KHB-47        162.55 MHz
Providence, RI          WXJ-39        162.40 MHz
Riverhead, NY           WXM-80        162.475 MHz


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
Small craft warnings will be displayed from sunrise to
sunset from Suffolk County Marine Police Patrol Boats
underway in the coastal and navigable inland waters of
Suffolk County Long Island New York: For boating sea-
son only.


AUTHORITIES 
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are warned to stay clear
of the protective riprap surrounding
navigational light structures.
