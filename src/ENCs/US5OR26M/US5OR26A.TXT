NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Wash., or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Portland, Oregon.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey and U.S. Coast Guard.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - RADIO BEACONS
Only marine radio beacons have been cali-
brated for surface use. Limitations on the use
of certain other radio signals as aids to marine
navigation can be found in U.S. Coast Guard
Light Lists and National Imagery and Mapping
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION
The depths of water expect for 
the area above the Pasco highway bridge, have 
been determined from conditions existing prior 
to the filling of the pool.  Shallower depths than
charted may exist, particularly near the shoreline.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The National Weather Service station listed
below provides continuous marine weather broad-
casts.  The range of reception is variable, but for
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the
antenna site.
Pendleton, OR		WXL-95		162.550 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace 
as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


SOUNDINGS AND CLEARANCES
Soundings and clearances of bridges and overhead cables are referred to normal pool 
level which is 340 feet above mean sea level.


COLUMBIA AND SNAKE RIVERS
Mileage distances along the Columbia and Snake Rivers are in Statute Miles.  Distances along 
the Columbia River are eastward from the mouth, and the Snake River are eastward from the 
junction of the Columbia River. Tables for converting statute miles to International Nautical
miles are given in Coast Pilot 7.
