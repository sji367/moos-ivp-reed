NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National 
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 
153).


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are urged to use caution when 
navigating in the area of this chart.  
Significant changes in depths and shore-
line may have occurred as a result of the 
earthquake of March 27, 1964.  The mag-
nitude of change is known only at selected 
sites which are indicated by note on the 
larger scale charts.


CAUTION - HYDROGRAPHIC
Hydrographic details and aids to navigation are 
not generally shown where larger scale coverage 
is available.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.

Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional

Survey, and National Geospatial-Intelligence

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, AK, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
AK.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.
