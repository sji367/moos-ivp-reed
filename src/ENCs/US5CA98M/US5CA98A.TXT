Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological
Survey, and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - WARNING
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted buoys,
snags, wrecks, and rocks exist along the shore of the lake.
Mariners should use caution when transiting near the shore.


NAVIGATING LAKE TAHOE 
Lake Tahoe is to be navigated by leaving all white
with orange band buoys to port when transiting in
a clockwise direction.  Safe water will always be
found toward the center on the lake from the white
and orange band federal buoys.  The water level
changes daily.  Unmarked rocks and other hazards
could be exposed due to low water levels.  Mariners
should use caution when approaching the shore.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES 
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as
well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot
