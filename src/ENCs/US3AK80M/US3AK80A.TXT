NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed

nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, U.S. Coast Guard and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.
 

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
