AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Galveston,
Texas.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers. 


NOTE G
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the Houston, Galveston, and
Texas City waterways. Vessel operating procedures and
designated radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33
CFR 161; Chapter 2 U.S. Coast Pilot; and/or the VTS User's
Manual. Mariners should consult these sources for applicable
rules and reporting requirements. "Houston Traffic" is a full
service VTS, providing a continuous Information Service;
Traffic Organization Services as requisite; and Navigation
Assistance Service upon request.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small
craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY - AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use
with nautical charts and the exact meaning of an aid to
navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart is
consulted. 
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway
exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids
marking other waterways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway westward from
Carrabelle, Florida to Brownsville, Texas, aids with yellow
triangles should be kept on the starboard side of the vessel
and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side
of the vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information,
but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the
Intracoastal Waterway.
CAUTION - SURVEY
Survey platforms, signs, pipes, piles, and
stakes, some submerged, may exist along the
maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not
charted where they interfere with a light symbol.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that
channel.
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should
pass port to port.
When Motorboats approach each other at right angles or
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication
"Navigation Rules".


CAUTION - WARNING CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's
superstructure may block the wind with the result that
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small
craft close to their bows.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals
are required for fixed mineral development
structures, Subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast
Guard (33 CFR 67).


ARTICULATED AIDS
An articulated aid to navigation consists of a
pipe structure that oscillates around a universal
coupling connected to a sinker. The structure is
kept upright by the buoyancy of a submerged
floatation chamber. It is designed primarily to
mark narrow channels in depths of up to 60
feet.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart 
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS

Coast Guard Auxiliary (USCGAUX), national organizations
of boatmen, conduct extensive boating instruction programs
in communities throughout the United States. For information
