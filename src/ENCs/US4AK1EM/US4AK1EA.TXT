NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated on this chart. See 
Notice to Mariners.
The buoys in Cook Inlet are seasonally 
maintained from May 1 to Nov.1.For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data 
from the Corps of Engineers U.S. Coast Guard,
and National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures shown on this chart, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations
Raspberry I, AK   	KZZ-90   	162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK   	        WNG-528   	162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK   	WNG-531   	162.525 MHz
Ninilchik, AK      	KZZ-97      	162.550 MHz
Homer, AK       	WXJ-24      	162.400 MHz


VESSEL TRANSITING
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill 
Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum 
distances from a shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along 
the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, 
California. See U.S.Coast Pilot 9, Chapter 3 for details.


TIDAL INFORMATION 
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


CAUTION - THE COOK INLET AREA
The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-
seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower 
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed 
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 
11.5fathoms or less on this chart were adjusted accordingly to account for this 
uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to 
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise 
caution.


CAUTION
Oil exploration and production operations 
are being conducted in the waters of Cook Inlet. 
Drilling vessels and movable and permanent 
platforms are being used. Only permanent 
platforms are charted. Mariners are urged to 
exercise caution when transiting the area.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
