SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS: For Symbols and Abbreviations, see Chart No. 1.

AUTHORITIES: Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with 
additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, U.S. Coast Guard and 
National Gespatial-Intelligence Agency.



AIDS TO NAVIGATION: Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning 
aids to navigation.



FISH AGGREGATING DEVICES (FADS): FADS are established along the coastal waters of the 
main Hawai'ian Islands.



NOTE A: Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.  
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. 
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of the District Engineer, 
Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers.

NOTE B:
Submerged submarine operations are conducted at various times in the waters contained 
on this chart. Proceed with caution.



WARNING – PRUDENT MARINER: The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, 
particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot.



POLLUTION REPORTS: Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center 
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).



NOTE S: Regulations for Ocean Dumping Sites are contained in 40 CFR, 
Parts 220-228. Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements 
for use of the sites may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
See U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for addresses of EPA offices. Dumping subsequent to the 
survey dates may have reduced the depths shown.



SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.



CAUTION: Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.



CAUTION IMPROVED CHANNELS: Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

RADAR REFLECTORS: Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.



NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS: The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 
100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.


Hawaii Kai, HI		KBA-99		162.40 MHz
Mt Haleakala, HI	KBA-99		162.40 MHz		



NOTE X(TERRITORIAL SEA): Within the 12-nautical mile Territorial Sea established by Presidential Proclamation, 
some Federal laws apply. The Three Nautical Mile Line, previously identified as the outer limit of the territorial sea, 
is retained as it continues to depict the jurisdictional limit of other laws. 
The 9-nautical mile Nautical Resource Boundary off the Gulf coast of Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, 
and the Three Federal fisheries jurisdiction and the outer limit of the jurisdiction of the states. 
he 24-nautical mile Contiguous Zone and the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone were established by Presidential Proclamation. 
Unless fixed by treaty for the U.S. Supreme Court, these amaritime limits are subject to modification. 




Administration Area
This area covers land, internal waters and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a 
maritime zone over which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the 
Coast Pilot.

USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to 
detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may 
exist in federal channels.
