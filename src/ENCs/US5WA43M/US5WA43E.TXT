NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not include in the U.S.
Coast Guard Light List.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is
impossible (33 CFR 153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.



RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.



CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.
The cable and pipeline areas falling
within the areas of the larger scale Cana-
dian charts are not shown.



COLREGS, 80.1390 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated.  See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CANADIAN WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The Canadian Weather Service station listed
below provides continuous marine weather broad-
casts. The range of reception is variable, but for
most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles from the
antenna site.

Vancouver, B.C.		CFA-240		162.40 MHz


NOTE E - COOPERATIVE VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES SYSTEM
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system
has been established by the United States and Canada
within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region.
The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Tofino Traffic,
Seattle Traffic, and Victoria Traffic) administers the rules
issued by both nations, however, it will enforce only its
own set of rules within its jurisdiction.

Service, Charting and Geodetic Services, with additional
data from the Geological Survey, Corps of Engineer, U.S.
Coast Guard and Canadian Authorities.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
