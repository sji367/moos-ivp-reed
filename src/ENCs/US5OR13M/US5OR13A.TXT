NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial - Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction - finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important 
supplemental information.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone over 
which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and 
subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.

RADAR REFLECTORS 
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological 
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.

STATUTE MILES - COLUMBIA RIVER
Mileage distances along the Columbia Rivers are in
Statute Miles. Distances along the Columbia River are
eastward from the mouth.
Tables for converting Statute Miles to International Nautical 
Miles are given in Coast Pilot 7.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Astoria, OR	KEC-91	162.400 MHz
Portland,OR	KIG-98	162.550 MHz
Olympia, WA	WXM-62	162.475 MHz


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to 
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.


CAUTION - LOG STORAGE AREAS
The limits of log storage areas are variable and
only known areas are shown on this chart. Mariners
should exercise caution in these areas.


SOUNDING DATUM
Columbia River Datum: Mean Lower Low Water During Lower River Stages.


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to 
detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may 
exist in federal channels.
