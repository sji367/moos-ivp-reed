NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 2. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning
the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
New York, NY.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE Z
This chart falls entirely within the limits of a No-Discharge 
Zone (NDZ). Under the Clean Water Act, Section 312, all vessels 
operating within a No-Discharge Zone (NDZ) are completely 
prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or untreated, 
into the waters. All vessels with an installed marine sanitation 
device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored, or docked 
within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent the overboard 
discharge of sewage (treated or untreated) or install a holding 
tank. Regulations for the NDZ are contained in the U.S. Coast Pilot. 
Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements 
may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
web site: http://www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/regulatory/vessel_sewage/.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or removed. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Meriden, CT	WXJ-42    162.40 MHz
New York, NY	KWO-35	  162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY	WXM-80	  162.475 MHz


CAUTION
Mariners are warned to stay clear of the pro-
tective riprap surrounding navigational light
structures.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of certain other radio signals 
as aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Imagery and 
Mapping Agency Publication 117.  
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS
During the boating season small-craft warnings
will be displayed from sunrise to sunset on
Suffolk County Marine Police Patrol Boats while
underway in the coastal and navigable inland
waters of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.
