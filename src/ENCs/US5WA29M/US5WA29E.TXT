AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for

supplemental information concerning aids to

navigation.





CAUTION - LIMITATIONS

Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine 
navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard 
Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.

Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and

should be used with caution.



RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.




CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.





POLLUTION REPORTS

Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-

stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.

Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).





SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.



ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.




NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS

The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broad
casts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the 
antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

COLREGS, 80.1385 (see note A)

International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.

The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.





ANCHORING STANDARDS OF CARE

Anchoring Standards of Care have been established for this area through the Harbor

Safety Plan. These Standards of Care supplement existing regulations with good

marine practices for anchoring, and are separated into different weather categories.

If your vessel does not have a copy of the Anchoring Standards of Care, you can

download one at http://pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or contact(206) 443-3830.





LIGHTERING STANDARDS OF CARE

Lightering Standards of Care have been established for this area through the Harbor

Safety Plan. These Standards of Care supplement existing regulations with good marine

practices for lightering. If your vessel does not have a copy of the Lightering Standards
of Care, you can download one at http://Pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or 
contact 
(206) 443-3830.





NOTE A

Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.

Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-

lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning 
the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the 
Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or 
at 
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Seattle, Washington.

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.





WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER

The prudent mariner will not rely solely 
on
any single aid to navigation, particularly 
on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

NOTE C
TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
	
One-way traffic lanes overprinted on this chart are RECOMMENDED for use by
all vessels traveling between the points involved. They have been designated to
aid in the prevention of collisions in the Strait of Juan De Fuca water, but are
not intended in any to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the
Road. Separation Zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic
and to be free of ship traffic. Separation Zones should not be used except
for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation Zones, use
extreme caution.
Precautionary Areas have been established where major lanes merge
and cross the traffic separation scheme.  It is recommended that vessels proceed
with caution in these areas. Wherever practical, vessels entering or leaving the
system should do so at these precautionary areas.  For more information regarding
Traffic Separation Scheme procedures and regulations, see 33 CFR 167 and/or
Chapter 2 of the U.S. Coast Pilot.

	

MANDATORY VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system in the U.S. Waters covered by this chart. Vessel operating procedures and designated radio-telephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual.
