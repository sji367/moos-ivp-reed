TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
	One-way traffic lanes overprinted on this chart are RECOMMENDED for use by all vessels traveling between the points involved.  They have been designated to aid in the prevention of collisions in the Strait of Juan De Fuca and Its Approaches, Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound and Its Approaches, Haro Strait, and Boundary Pass waters, but are not intended in any way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road.  Separation zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to be free of ship traffic.  Separation zones should not be used except for crossing purposes.  When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones, use extreme caution.
	Precautionary Areas have been established where major lanes merge and cross the traffic separation scheme.  It is recommended that vessels proceed with caution in these areas.  Wherever practical, vessels entering or leaving the system should do so at these precautionary areas.  For more information regarding Traffic Separation Scheme procedures and regulations, see 33 CFR 167 and/or Chapter 2 of the U.S. Coast Pilot.
