NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 11th Coast Guard District in Alameda, California or at the
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in San Francisco,
California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations
are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids.
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free),
or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone
communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to
navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on
these aids has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous
weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles
for stations at high elevations.

Mt. Umunhum, CA	KEC-49		162.550 MHz
Mt. Umunhum, CA	WWF-64		162.450 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may
exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines
and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were
originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their
draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information
concerning aids to navigation.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to
http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


USACE HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS
USACE conducts hydrographic surveys to monitor navigation conditions. These surveys are not intended to 
detect underwater features. Uncharted features hazardous to surface navigation are not expected but may 
exist in federal channels.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. This area  
covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a maritime zone which 
the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its bed and 
subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
