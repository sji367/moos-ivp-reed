Channel legends in the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor are based on
the most recent surveys conducted by the Corps of Engineers.
The Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor entrance is subject to seasonal
shoaling and dredging operations from November through May.
The Santa Cruz Harbormaster reports that the inner harbor has been
dredged from 7 to 10 feet in depth.
Buoy positions are frequently changed to mark the shifting channel.
Mariners without local knowledge should contact the Harbormaster on
VHF-FM channel 16, 24 hours daily, or telephone 1-831-475-6161
between 0830 and 1700 daily.
Mariners should not attempt to enter the harbor when there are heavy
swells without first contacting the Harbormaster.
