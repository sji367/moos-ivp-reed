33 CFR 165.761 Vessels may be allowed to transit the Intracoast-
al Waterway when passenger vessels or vessels carrying 
cargoes of particular hazard are berthed, by staying east 
of the law enforcement vessels and cruise ship tenders, 
which will mark a transit lane in the Intracoastal Wa-
terway. Periodically, vessels may be required to tempo-
rarily hold their positions while large commercial traf-
fic operates in this area. Vessels in this security zone 
must follow the orders of the COTP or his designated 
representative, who may be embarked in law enforce-
ment or other vessels on scene. When passenger vessels 
are not berthed on the Intracoastal Waterway, naviga-
tion will be unrestricted. Law enforcement vessels can 
be contacted on VHF Marine Band Radio Channel 16 
(156.8 MHz).
