Mariners are encouraged to use extreme CAUTION when approaching Kachemak
Bay on a south or central course due to extreme heavy concentration of fixed crab
fishing gear and fishing vessels. Vessel transits to and from Homer not more than 
two miles seaward from the 18.3 meters/10 fathom curve from Anchor Point to Bluff Point should 
clear the fixed gear.
