The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings have changed throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 21 meters/11.5 fathoms or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise caution.
