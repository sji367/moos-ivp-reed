NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometres / 20 to 40 nautical miles. from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 185 kilometres/100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 4 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to com-
mercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S 
Coast Guard.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been
damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to 
navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the
nearest United States Coast Guard unit. 


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
7th Coast Guard District in Miami, Florida., or at the Office 
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Charleston, 
South Carolina.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
