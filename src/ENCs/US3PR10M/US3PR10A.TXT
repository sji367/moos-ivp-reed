NOTES:


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.
See the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency List of Lights and Fog Signals for Information not 
included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the 
nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 7th Coast Guard 
District in Miami, Florida, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Jacksonville, Florida.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency, Geological Survey, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, and British Admiralty charts.


NOTE C
CAUTION 
This chart is intended for offshore navigation only.  In inshore areas, detailed information, including navigational aids, has been omitted.  In these areas use large scale charts.  See index diagram.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light 
List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine 
pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. 
Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and 
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting 
stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation 
and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline 
may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys 
may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.Mariners 
should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been 
displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. Mariners are urged to exercise extreme 
caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States 
Coast Guard unit.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids 
has been omitted from this chart.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts.The reception range is typically 20 to 
40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

San Juan, PR		WXJ-69	    162.400 MHz
Maricao, PR		WXJ-68	    162.550 MHz
St. Thomas, VI	     	WXM-96      162.475 MHz
