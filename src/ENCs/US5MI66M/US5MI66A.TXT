NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 6. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Com-
mander, 9th Coast Guard District in Cleveland, Ohio or at
the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in
Detroit, Michigan.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOTE D
Mariners are warned that numerous uncharted stakes and fishing structures,
some submerged, may exist in the area of this chart. Such structures are not
charted unless known to be permanent.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important
supplemental information.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site,but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Alpena, MI		KIG-83		162.550 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.  


BRIDGE AND OVERHEAD CABLE CLEARANCES
When the water surface is above Low Water
Datum, bridge and overhead clearances are reduced correspondingly.  For clearances see U.S.
Coast Pilot 6.


CAUTION - POTABLE WATER INTAKE
Vessels operating in fresh water lakes or rivers shall not discharge
sewage, or ballast, or bilge water within such areas adjacent to domestic
water intakes as are designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs
(21 CFR 1250.93).  Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 6 for important supplemental
information.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of the radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial - Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details 
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LOW WATER DATUM
Due to periodic high water conditions in the Great Lakes,
some features charted as visible at Low water Datum may
be submerged, particularly in the near shore areas.
Mariners should proceed with caution.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SAILING COURSES
Sailing courses and limits are recommended by
the Lake Carriers Association and the Canadian Shipowners Association.


SAILING DIRECTIONS
Bearings of sailing courses are true and distances given thereon are in
statute miles between points of departure.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.
