NOTES:
AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.

POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.  Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.

WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 5. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 8th Coast Guard District in New Orleans, LA, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in New Orleans, LA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.

NOTE S
Regulations for Ocean Dumping Sites are contained in 40 CFR, Parts 220-229. Additional information concerning the regulations and requirements for use of the sites may be obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  See U.S. Coast Pilots appendix for addresses of EPA offices. Dumping subsequent to the survey dates may have reduced the depths shown.

AUTHORITIES

CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's superstructure may block the wind with the result that sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small craft close to their bows.

CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large commercial and government vessels even if small craft have the right-of-way.
All craft should avoid areas where the skin divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white stripe, is displayed.

HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations.  Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative.  Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved.  Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral development structures shown, subject to approval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).

RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.

TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information, see the NOS tide table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov

INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY (ALTERNATE ROUTE) MORGAN CITY TO PORT ALLEN
The Project Depth is 3.6 meters/12 feet meters from Morgan City, Louisiana to Port Allen, Louisiana.
The controlling depths are published periodically in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners.
Mileage distances shown along the Waterway are in Statute Miles, based on zero at the junction with the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at Morgan City.  Tables for converting Statute Miles to International Nautical Miles are given in U.S. Coast Pilot 5.

INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY (LANDSIDE ROUTE) MORGAN CITY TO PORT ALLEN
The controlling depth was 2.1 meters/7 feet Sep. 1994 to its junction with the Alternate Route in the Lower Grand River.
The controlling depths are published periodically in the U.S. Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners.
Mileage distances shown along the Waterway are in Statute Miles, based on zero at the junction of Bayou Boeuf and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.  Tables for converting Statute Miles to International Nautical Miles are given in U.S. Coast Pilot 5.

INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is designed for use with nautical charts, and the exact meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear unless the appropriate chart is consulted.  Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waterways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway westward from Carrabelle, FL to Brownsville, TX, aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow squares should be kept on the port side of the vessel.  
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral information, but simply identifies aids to navigation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.

ATCHAFALAYA RIVER ROUTE
The Navigation Project is 3.6 meters/12 feet deep by 38.1 meters/125 feet wide from the Mississippi River via Old River, Atchafalaya River, Grand Lake and Sixmile Lake at Morgan City, LA.
The controlling depths are published periodically in Navigation Bulletins issued by the New Orleans District Corps of Engineers, New Orleans, LA.  Buoys are not charted.

VERMILION RIVER
The controlling depths were 2.7 meters/9 feet on centerline from the Intracoastal Waterway to the Perry Bridge; thence 
1.8 meters/6 feet on centerline to the Broussard Bridge; thence 0.6 meters/2 feet on centerline to the Ambassador Caffery Bridge; thence shoal to bare to the Pinhook Bridge.  Use of local knowledge is recommended.  
Apr 2015

ACADIANA NAVIGATION CHANNEL
The channel is privately maintained with a controlling depth of 3.0 meters/10 feet reported from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Depth to the main entrance of the port. Depths along the edge of the channel may be subject to shoaling.
October 2002

RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases.  Sailing vessels and motorboats less than 19.8 meters/65 feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that channel.  A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way.  Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should pass port to port.  When motorboats approach each other at right angles or obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most cases.  
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when safe and practicable.  Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication "Navigation Rules".

PUBLIC BOATING INSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
