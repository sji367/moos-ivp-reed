NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 7.
Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners.
Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the
Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the Office
of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, Washington. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


PUGET SOUND HARBOR SAFETY PLAN
The US Coast Guard and the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee have developed 
and adopted a Harbor Safety Plan that formally established a set of Standards of Care 
for Puget Sound and surrounding waters. These Standards of Care are intended to 
supplement existing regulations by documenting good marine practices fora variety 
of operations including tug escorts, pilotage, anchoring, lightering, and provides 
additional information on required charts, Aids to Navigation and Emergency Response. 
If your vessel does not already have a copy of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Plan, 
log on to http://pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or contact the Seattle Marine 
Exchange at (206)443-3830.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning
aids to navigation. 
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not
included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey,
with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Canadian Surveys and
U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.
See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation
can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations
are subject to error and should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.
Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist
within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine
cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried
may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating
vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines
and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but
can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Neah Bay, WA		KIH-36		162.550 MHz
Puget Sound, WA		WWG-24		162.425 MHz
Seattle, WA.		KHB-60		162.550 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center
via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if
telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


COLREGS, 80.1385 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation,
particularly on floating aids. 
See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SMALL ARMS SAFETY ZONE
Naval Air Station small arms range operates 7 days a week.
Red flashing light and flags are displayed during live fire exercises.
Use caution when transiting near the zone.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE H
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system has been established by the
United States and Canada within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region. 
The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Prince Rupert Traffic, Seattle Traffic,
and Victoria Traffic) administers the rules issued by both nations; however, it
will enforce only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction.


NOTE B
Naval vessels may be maneuvering in circles in this area. Proceed with caution.
For further information consult Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners.
