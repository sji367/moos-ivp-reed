NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


PUGET SOUND HARBOR SAFETY PLAN
The US Coast Guard and the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee have developed 
and adopted a Harbor Safety Plan that formally established a set of Standards of Care 
for Puget Sound and surrounding waters. These Standards of Care are intended to 
supplement existing regulations by documenting good marine practices fora variety 
of operations including tug escorts, pilotage, anchoring, lightering, and provides 
additional information on required charts, Aids to Navigation and Emergency Response. 
If your vessel does not already have a copy of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Plan, 
log on to http://pshsc.org/about/harbor_safety_plan or contact the Seattle Marine 
Exchange at (206)443-3830.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation. 
See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog
Signals for information not included in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Light List.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast 
Survey, with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Canadian 
Surveys and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES and CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Neah Bay, WA		KIH-36		162.550 MHz
Puget Sound, WA		WWG-24		162.425 MHz
Seattle, WA.		KHB-60		162.550 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response 
Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility 
if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


COLREGS, 80.1385 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at sea, 1972. 
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid 
to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast 
Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


SMALL ARMS SAFETY ZONE
Naval Air Station small arms range operates 
7 days a week. Red flashing light and flags are 
displayed during live fire exercises. Use caution 
when transiting near the zone.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS Tide Table publication or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Additional information can be obtained at www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov


NOTE H
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS) system 
has been established by the United States and Canada 
within the adjoining waters in the Juan de Fuca Region. 
The appropriate Vessel Traffic Center (VTC) (Tofino Traffic, 
Seattle Traffic, and Victoria Traffic) administers the rules 
issued by both nations; however, it will enforce only its 
own set of rules within its jurisdiction.


NOTE B
Naval vessels may be mareuvering in circles
in this area. Proceed with caution , For further 
information consult Coast Guard Local Notice 
to Mariners.
