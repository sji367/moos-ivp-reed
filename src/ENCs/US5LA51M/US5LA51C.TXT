The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel
Traffic Services (VTS) system in the Lower Mississippi
River. Vessel operating procedures and designated
radiotelephone frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, The
U.S. Coast Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. Mariners
should consult these sources for applicable rules and
reporting requirements. Although mandatory VTS parti-
cipation is limited to the navigable waters of the United
States, certain vessels are encouraged or may be required,
as a condition of port entry, to report beyond this area to
facilitate advance vessel traffic management within the
VTS area.
