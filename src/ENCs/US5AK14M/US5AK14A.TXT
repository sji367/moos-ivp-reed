NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important supplemental information.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area. 
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is 
a maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the 
airspace as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please 
refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.
The buoys in Cook Inlet are seasonally maintained
from May 1 to Nov 1.  For details see U.S.
Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.
	
Bede Mt, AK	WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Rugged, AK	WNG-526		162.425 MHz
Ninilchik, AK	KZZ-97		162.550 MHz
Soldotna, AK	WWG-39		162.475 MHz

Anchorage, AK	KEC-43		162.550 MHz


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals are required for fixed mineral
development structures shown on this chart, subject to approval by the District
Commander, U.S. Coast Guard (33 CFR 67).


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners. Information
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 17th
Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps
of Engineers in Anchorage, Alaska.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


COLREGS 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.
