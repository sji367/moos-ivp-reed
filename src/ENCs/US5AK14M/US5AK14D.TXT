The Cook Inlet area is affected by land uplift due to forces such as post-
seismic crustal rebound. As a result, the tidal datums including mean lower
low water, the plane of reference used for depth soundings, have changed
throughout this region. Tidal datums were updated in 1999 and depths of 
21 meters/11.5 fathoms or less were adjusted accordingly to account for this
uplift. As the uplift rates can only be estimated and areas continue to
rise, depths may be shoaler than charted. Mariners are urged to exercise
caution. 

Numerous uncharted and dangerous submerged 
boulders exist in the eastern portion of Cook Inlet.  
Mariners should use extreme caution in this area.

Oil exploration and production operations are being conducted in the waters 
of Cook Inlet. Drilling vessels and movable and permanent platforms are being 
used. Only permanent platforms are charted. Mariners are urged to exercise 
caution when transiting the area.
