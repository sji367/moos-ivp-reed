NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provides continuous weather broadcasts. 
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK 		KZZ-90 		162.425 MHz 
Pillar Mt, AK 			WNG-531 	162.525 MHz    
Kodiak, AK 			WXJ-78 		162.550 MHz
Sitkinak Dome, AK		WNG-718		162.450 MHz

CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have
occurred in the area of this chart as a result of the earthquake
of March 27, 1964.  Tidal observations since the earthquake
indicate bottom subsidence of  -3.7 feet at Uganik Bay.
Mariners are urged to use extreme caution when navigating
in the area of this chart as the magnitude of change
except at this site is not known.

Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
