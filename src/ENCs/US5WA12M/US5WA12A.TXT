NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional 
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notices to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington, or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


BASCULE BRIDGE CLEARANCES
For bascule bridges, whose spans do not
open to a full upright or vertical position, unlimited
vertical clearance is not available for the entire
charted horizontal clearance.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


RACING BUOYS
Racing buoys within the limits of this chart
are not shown hereon. Information may be
obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard District
Offices as racing and other private buoys are
not all listed in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio station listed
below provides continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Seattle, WA.		KHB-60		162.550 MHz


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National
Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - MARINERS
Mariners are cautioned that a large number of logs and deadheads
are adrift in the navigable waters of Oregon and Washington at all
times, particularly after storms, spring freshets, and unusually high
tides.


COLREGS, 80.1395(see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area.
Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


TIDAL INFORMATION

ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an Administration Area.
This area covers land, internal waters, and territorial sea.  The territorial sea is a
maritime zone which the United States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace
as well as to its bed and subsoil.  For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


NOTE C
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) system in the Puget Sound area. Vessel
operating procedures and designated radiotelephone
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the  U.S. Coast
Pilot, and/or the VTS User's Manual. The entire area of
the chart falls within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS)
system.
