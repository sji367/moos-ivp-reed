NOTES:
NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. 
Coast Pilot 7. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the 
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
11th Coast Guard District in Long Beach, CA or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in 
San Francisco, California.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and toporaphy by the National Ocean Service, Coast
Survey, wih additional data from the Corps of Engineers, and U.S.
Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important
supplemental information.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio
signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-intelligence
Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broad-
casting stations are subject to error and should be used
with caution.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORAR CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  
The reception range is typically 20 to 40
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at
high elevations.

Eureka, CA		KEC-82		162.400 MHz WX2
Point Arena, CA		KIH-30		162.550 MHz WX1

OFFSHORE VESSEL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the West Coast Offshore Vessel Traffic Risk Management Project, which was co-sponsored 
by the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force and U.S. Guard Pacific Area, it is 
recommended that, where no other traffic management areas exist such as Traffic Separation Schemes, 
Vessel Traffic Services, or recommended routes, vessels 300 gross tons or larger transiting along the 
coast anywhere between Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay a minimum distance of 25 
nautical miles offshore. It is also recommended that tank ships laden with persistent petroleum products 
and transiting along the coast between Cook Inlet and San Diego should voluntarily stay a minimum 
distance of 50 nautical miles offshore. Vessels transiting short distances between adjacent ports should 
seek routing guidance as needed from the local Captain of the Port or VTS authority for that area. This 
recommendation is intended to reduce the potential for vessel groundings and resulting oil spills in the 
event of a vessel casualty.


ADMONISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of administration area.this area covers
land, internal waters, and territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the united
states exercises sovereignty extending to the air space as well as to its bed and subsoil. For more
information, please referto the coast pilot
