AUTHORITIES
Hydrography (surveys of 1969) and topography by the National 
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the Corps of 
Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 2. Additions 
or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information 
concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 
1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or at the Office of the District Engineer, 
Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 2 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See 
Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are 
replaced by other types or removed. For details, see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


NOAA VHF-FM WEATHER BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather 
broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 km / 20 to 40 nautical 
miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 186 km / 100 nautical 
miles for stations at high elevations. 

Hartford, CT		WXJ-41		162.475 MHz 
Meriden, CT		WXJ-42		162.40 MHz
New London, CT	KHB-47		162.55 MHz
Riverhead, NY		WXM-80		162.475 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within 
the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are 
required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become 
exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths 
of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, 
and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.
