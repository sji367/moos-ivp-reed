AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9.  Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska, or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage.
Alaska.
Refer to charted regulations section numbers. 


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on 
any single aid to navigation, particularly on 
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List 
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication 
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated.  See 
Local Notice to Mariners.
During some winter months or when endan-
gered by ice, certain aids to navigation are
replaced by other types or remove. For details
see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
 Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Raspberry I, AK		KZZ-90		162.425 MHz
Bede Mt, AK		WNG-528		162.450 MHz
Pillar Mt, AK           WNG-531		162.525 MHz
Kodiak, AK		WXJ-78		162.550 MHz
Marmot island, AK       WNG-716         162.500 MHZ


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many 
floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar 
reflector identification on these aids has been 
omitted from this chart.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


CAUTION - WOMENS BAY
Womens Bay and the area adjacent to the
entrance channel was surveyed in 1978.
Depths outside this area reflect conditions
prior to the earthquake of 1964.


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.
