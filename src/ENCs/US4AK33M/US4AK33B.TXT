The zero fathom curve in Chilkat Inlet at 

the mouth of the Chilkat River is shown

as surveyed in 1998. Significant amounts 

of sediment are being deposited in this 

area by the river, resulting in the advance 

of the zero fathom curve an average of 246 meters/75 

feet per year (based on the position change 

from 1890 to 1998).
