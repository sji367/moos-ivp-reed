AUTHORITIES: Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional data from the U.S. Coast Guard, Geological Survey, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Department of the Navy.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION: Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.  

NOTE A: Navigation regulations are published in NGA Publication 126 or weekly Notice to Mariners which include new or revised regulations.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu, Hawaii or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Refer to Code of Federal Regulations section numbers. 

WARNING – PRUDENT MARINER: The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot, and NGA pub.126 for details.

POLLUTION REPORTS: Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: Consult NGA Pub.126 for important supplemental information.

CAUTION: Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated.  See Local Notice to Mariners.

CAUTION: Surface, subsurface, and aircraft operations including firing exercises are conducted at various times within an approximate 220 mile radius of Guam.

RADAR REFLECTORS: Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation.  Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS: The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts.  The reception range is typically 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations.

Guam		WXM-85		162.40 MHz

SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES: Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area.  Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exists, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling.  
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.

ACOUSTIC RANGE FACILITY: Numerous shore connected bottom cables are located within the area.
