NOTES:
AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National
Ocean Service, Coast Survey, with additional
data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological
Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 9 for important 
supplemental information.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via 
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. 
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


COLREGS, 80.1705 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this Chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in 
Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 9. Additions or 
revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the 
Notice to Mariners. Information concerning 
the regulations may be obtained at the Office 
of the Commander, 17th Coast Guard District 
in Juneau, Alaska or at the Office of the District 
Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Anchorage, 
Alaska. 
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed 
below provide continuous weather broadcasts.
The reception range is typically 20 to 40 
nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be 
as much as 100 nautical miles for stations at 
high elevations.

Point Pigot, AK		KZZ-93		162.450 MHz
Potato Point, AK	WNG-527		162.425 MHz
Cape Hinchinbrook	WNG-532		162.525 MHz
Valdez, AK		WXJ-63		162.550 MHz
Cordova, AK		WXJ-79		162.400 MHz
East Point, AK		WNG-530		162.500 MHz
Tripod Mountain, AK	WNG-715		162.450 MHz


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


CAUTION - SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
Significant changes in depths and shoreline may have occurred 
in the area of this chart as a result of the earthquake of march 27, 
1964. Tidal observations since the earthquake indicate bottom uplift 
of +4.3feet at Port Gravina. Mariners are urged to use extreme 
caution when navigating in the area of this chart as the magnitude 
of change except in Port Valdez, Tatilek Narrows, Jack Bay, and the 
offshore corridor of Valdez Arm is not known. Important changes 
from preliminary topographic surveys are charted.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.
