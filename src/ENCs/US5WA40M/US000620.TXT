WARINING- PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on
any single aid to navigation, particularly on
floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List
and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for
supplemental information concerning aids to
navigation.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous sub-
stances to the National Response Center via
1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S.
Coast Guard facility if telephone communication
is impossible (33 CFR 153).


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 7 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to
navigation are not indicated. See
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and
submarine cables may exist within the area of
this chart.  Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and
those that were originally buried may have
become exposed.  Mariners should use extreme
caution when operating vessels in depths of
water comparable to their draft in areas where
pipelines and cables may exist, and when
anchoring, dragging, or trawling.
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as
aids to marine navigation can be found in the
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117.
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial
broadcasting stations are subject to error and
should be used with caution.


CANADIAN WEATHER RADIO BROADCAST
The Canadian Weather Service station listed
below provides continuous marine weather
broadcasts.  The range of reception is variable,
but for most stations is usually 20 to 40 miles
from the antenna site.

Vancouver, B.C.		CFA-240		162.40 MHz


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar Reflectors have been placed on many
floating aids to navigation. Individual radar
reflector identification on these aids has been
omitted from this chart.


NOTE D
The U.S. Coast Guard operates a mandatory Vessel Traffic
Services (VTS) 
system in the Puget Sound area.  Vessel
operating procedures and 
designated radiotelephone
frequencies are published in 33 CFR 161, the 
U.S. Coast Pilot,
and/or the VTS User's Manual.  The entire area of the 
chart falls
within the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) system.


COLREGS, 80.1350 (see note A)
International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.
The entire area of this chart falls seaward of the COLREGS Demarcation Line.


NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S.
Coast Pilot 7.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are pub-
lished in the Notice to Mariners.  Information concerning the
regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander,
13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the 
Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in

Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


ADMINISTRATION AREA
The entire extent of this ENC cell falls within the limits of an
Administration Area. This area covers land, internal waters, and
territorial sea. The territorial sea is a maritime zone which the United
States exercises sovereignty extending to the airspace as well as to its
bed and subsoil. For more information, please refer to the Coast Pilot.


TIDAL INFORMATION
For tidal information see the NOS tide table publication, or go to http://co-ops.nos.noaa.gov.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
