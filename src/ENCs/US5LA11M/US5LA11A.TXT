NOTES:
POLLUTION REPORTS 
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the 
National Response Center via 1-800 424-8802 (toll free), or 
to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone com-
munication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for 
supplemental information concerning aids to 
navigation.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to 
navigation are not indicated. See 
Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - DREDGED AREAS
Improved channels are 
subject to shoaling, particularly at the edges.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Consult U.S. Coast Pilot 5 for important supplemental information.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and 
submarine cables may exist within the area of 
this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and sub-
marine cables are required to be buried, and 
those that were originally buried may have 
become exposed. Mariners should use extreme 
caution when operating vessels in depths of 
water comparable to their draft in areas where 
pipelines and cables may exist, and when 
anchoring, dragging, or trawling. 
Covered wells may be marked by lighted or 
unlighted buoys.


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as 
aids to marine navigation can be found in the 
U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National 
Geospatial-intelligence Agency Publication 117. 
Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial 
broadcasting stations are subject to error and 
should be used with caution.


INTRACOASTAL WATERWAY AIDS
The U.S. Aids to Navigation System is de-
signed for use with nautical charts and the exact 
meaning of an aid to navigation may not be clear 
unless the appropriate chart is consulted.
Aids to navigation marking the Intracoastal 
Waterway exhibit unique yellow symbols to 
distinguish them from aids marking other water-
ways.
When following the Intracoastal Waterway 
westward form the Carrabelle, Florida to Brownsville, TX, 
aids with yellow triangles should be kept on the 
starboard side of the vessel and aids with yellow 
squares should be kept on the port side of the 
vessel.
A horizontal yellow band provides no lateral 
information, but simply identifies aids to navi-
gation as marking the Intracoastal Waterway.


CAUTION - HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause 
considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored 
vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. 
Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual 
conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been 
damaged or destroyed.  Buoys may have been moved from their charted 
positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. 
Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to 
navigation.  Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced 
from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. 
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to 
report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the 
nearest United States Coast Guard unit.

RULES OF THE ROAD (ABRIDGED)
Motorless craft have the right-of-way in almost all cases. 
Sailing vessels and motorboats less than sixty-five feet in 
length shall not hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe 
passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside that 
Channel
A motorboat being overtaken has the right-of-way. 
Motorboats approaching head to head or nearly so should 
pass port to port. 
When motorboats approach each other at right angles or 
obliquely, the boat on the right has the right-of-way in most 
cases.
Motorboats must keep to the right in narrow channels when 
safe and practicable.
Mariners are urged to become familiar with the complete text 
of the Rules of the Road in U.S. Coast Guard publication 
"Navigation Rules."


CAUTION - WARNINGS CONCERNING LARGE VESSELS
The "Rules of the Road" state that recreational boats shall 
not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate only 
within a narrow channel or fairway. Large vessels may 
appear to move slowly due to their large size but actually 
transit at speeds in excess of 12 knots, requiring a great 
distance in which to maneuver or stop. A large vessel's 
superstructure may block the wind with the result that 
sailboats and sailboards may unexpectedly find themselves 
unable to maneuver. Bow and stern waves can be hazardous 
to small vessels. Large vessels may not be able to see small 
craft close to their bows.


MINERAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURES
Obstruction lights and sound (fog) signals 
are required for fixed mineral development 
structures shown, subject to ap-
proval by the District Commander, U.S. Coast 
Guard (33 CFR 67).


CAUTION
All craft should avoid areas where the skin 
divers flag, a red square with a diagonal white 
stripe, is displayed.


CAUTION - SMALL CRAFT
Small craft should stay clear of large com-
mercial and government vessels even if small 
craft have the right-of-way.


CAUTION - SURVEY PLATFORMS
Survey platforms, signs, pipes, piles, and 
stakes, some submerged, may exist along the 
maintained channels. Piles and platforms are not 
charted where they interfere with a light symbol.


AUTHORITIES

Survey with additional data from the Corps of Engineers and U.S 
Coast Guard.
